Upper storage cabinets throughout the travel trailer are finished with our custom curved wood doors, coated in a bright white that's resistant to fingerprints. Inside are hydraulic hinges that keep the doors in place when they're fully open and add a soft close when you pull them shut.",

Plus, there are built-in counter features, like two multifunctional storage bins that rest flush with the surface behind the sink.",

Upper storage cabinets throughout the travel trailer are finished with our custom curved wood doors, coated in a bright white that's resistant to fingerprints. Inside are hydraulic hinges that keep the doors in place when they're fully open and add a soft close when you pull them shut.",

Plus, there are built-in counter features, like two multifunctional storage bins that rest flush with the surface behind the sink.",

Its aerodynamic body and roof profile slip through the air on the open road and help increase fuel efficiency. And the panoramic front windows let you take in the world around you - the whole reason you head out to explore in the first place. Get the Quality Guide",
            "Every adventurer needs a place to recharge and Basecamp doesn't overlook comfort for a second. When you're setting up camp somewhere hot, the optional air conditioning with two-speed fan will keep you cool. When you're surrounded by snow, the onboard furnace and hot water heater system(s) will warm things up with world-class efficiency.",
            "Quickly and smoothly expand Basecamp's living and storage space with an inflatable tube frame tent attachment. With two entry points and two rooms, the tent's versatility makes it easier to grab your gear and go or set up camp and relax for the day.",
            "Removable Tables Two tables make the perfect surface for entertaining, eating, and working. And when you want more room to move around, quickly stow them away.",
            "Outdoor Shower Use the pass-through in the bathroom wall to create an outdoor shower for your gear or yourself.",

            "Remote Work Station With a convertible table and USB ports/110V outlets all around, you can keep your devices charged on the road.",
            "Spradling Marine Fabric Basecamp seating is covered in antibacterial, mildew-resistant, stain-resistant, and flame-retardant fabric for lasting durability.",
            "Easy Access Load and unload larger gear that otherwise would be difficult to get through the main entry door.",
            "12V Tank Heaters Tank heaters help keep the tanks from freezing in colder conditions when you're not running the furnace. Turn on the furnace and you can turn the tank heaters off. It's a great power-saving combo for off-the-grid camping",
            "Solar Pre-wire Kit Pre-installed wiring makes it easy to hook up solar panels to your trailer and extend the amount of time you can stay powered up off the grid.",

Its aerodynamic body and roof profile slip through the air on the open road and help increase fuel efficiency. And the panoramic front windows let you take in the world around you - the whole reason you head out to explore in the first place. Get the Quality Guide",
            "Every adventurer needs a place to recharge and Basecamp doesn't overlook comfort for a second. When you're setting up camp somewhere hot, the optional air conditioning with two-speed fan will keep you cool. When you're surrounded by snow, the onboard furnace and hot water heater system(s) will warm things up with world-class efficiency.",
            "Quickly and smoothly expand Basecamp's living and storage space with an inflatable tube frame tent attachment. With two entry points and two rooms, the tent's versatility makes it easier to grab your gear and go or set up camp and relax for the day.",
            "Removable Tables Two tables make the perfect surface for entertaining, eating, and working. And when you want more room to move around, quickly stow them away.",

            "12V Tank Heaters Tank heaters help keep the tanks from freezing in colder conditions when you're not running the furnace. Turn on the furnace and you can turn the tank heaters off. It's a great power-saving combo for off-the-grid camping",

While you're traveling, you have plenty of room for passengers to ride along on the sofa and use the aisle. And when you get settled, you can extend the slide-out and pull down a large Murphy bed for a truly great night's sleep, plus lovely extras like reading lights and shelves for your books and glasses.",
            "Whether you're tailgating, entertaining friends, or just having a movie night, the Atlas' 40\" Samsung LED Smart TV with a built-in sound bar is perfect. When you're not using it, it stays tucked inside the entertainment cabinet under the Corian(r) countertop. Then, you simply push a button and it rises into position, right across from the sofa or Murphy bed.",

            "Right when you step inside, four upscale upholstered captain's chairs make a first impression, along with a sofa and two more side seats in the back. Each seat is covered in Ultraleather(r), a supple yet soft fabric that not only looks great but also stands up to wear and tear. It resists temperature change and is easy to clean, pet-friendly, and won't scratch or stain - so that first impression feeling lasts for years to&nbsp;come.",

A TV at the front of the main cabin is perfect for passengers in the captain's chairs, while riders in the back have their own TV. Your entertainment options in the Interstate 24GL will make the time on the road fly by.",
