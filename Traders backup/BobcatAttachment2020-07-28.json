      "Clear away dirt, dried mud, light snow and other debris",

      "Self-centering hydraulic angling: Keep the attachment centered on the machine and avoid offset. The unit stays directly in front of the machine to help with keeping the machine on the sidewalk not off to the side, reducing damage to surfaces outside of the desired cleaning area.",
      "Compact Design: Designed for maximum efficiency, the angle broom attachment is compact and highly maneuverable.",
      "Easy Maintenance: Quick-change rotor design makes bristle replacement quick and easy. By simply removing two bolts, the entire rotor is released.",
      "Angle Control: The smaller broom has manual angle up to 30 degrees left or right. The larger brooms feature electric-over-hydraulic control to provide infinite angle adjustment up to 25 degrees of angle adjustment to the left or right.",
      "Fingertip Controls: Precise attachment control helps to finish the job quickly and efficiently, without having to leave the comfort of the cab - applies to larger brooms with electric-over-hydraulic angle only.",
      "Multidirection Sweeping: Remove debris from curbs, gutters, corners, and obstacles by reversing the direction of the bristles (only available on 64 and 84 in. brooms)",
      "Flush Sweeping: Get as close as you want. Improved sweeping efficiency allows for flush sweeping to a curb or wall on the right side.",
      "High-Torque Motor: With heavier materials and debris, the high-torque motor allows for maximum power for more efficient sweeping.",
      "Storage Stands: Larger brooms include storage stands to provides maximum uptime protection by eliminating bristle distortion when the broom is not in use. On 68-inch and 84-inch angle broom attachments, the stands use a lever to swing the legs up or down. In the down position the legs are closer to the bristles to make attachment to the machine easier.",
      "Patented Spring Design: Provides optimum down-pressure, extended bristle life and excellent cleaning ability (not available on 48-inch).",
      "Bristles: Proven, replaceable, wafer polypropylene bristles provide excellent life and clean ability. Bristles have excellent durability and provide perfect flicking action for superior cleaning.",
      "Sweep a clean path easily and efficiently with the hydraulically-driven angle broom attachment. Quick removal jobs can be completed without damaging pavement surfaces.",
      "The broom bristles have a waved design, delivering more surface clearing ability. This clears a cleaner path and can sweep more snow or debris in one pass. The angle broom attachment is compact, maneuverable and easy to operate, replacing manual labor and hand brooms. Clean small and large areas with less effort and in less time.",
      "Reverse bristle rotation for dustpan sweeping available on the 64 and 84 in. brooms efficiently sweeps leaves, snow, and debris away from corners, curbs, buildings, and obstacles at a lower speed to reduce damage to the cab. Heavy duty bristles have improved wear and better visibility for the operator.",
      "The reversible angle brush is available for all new 400-800 series compact track loaders and skid-steers, as well as Bobcat Toolcats with the 7 Pin Attachment Control Kit.",
      "The angle broom attachment uses a hydraulically-driven, rotating broom that pushes dirt and other debris away from the machine. The angle broom will continuously sweep debris ahead of the machine or angle the broom to windrow material to the side. To easily sweep debris away from obstacles, the broom can reverse direction and pull toward the machine, leaving behind clean corners and angles."

      "Easy Maintenance: Quick-change rotor design makes bristle replacement quick and easy. By simply removing two bolts, the entire rotor is released.",
      "Angle Control: The smaller broom has manual angle up to 30 degrees left or right. The larger brooms feature electric-over-hydraulic control to provide infinite angle adjustment up to 25 degrees of angle adjustment to the left or right.",
      "Fingertip Controls: Precise attachment control helps to finish the job quickly and efficiently, without having to leave the comfort of the cab - applies to larger brooms with electric-over-hydraulic angle only.",
      "Multidirection Sweeping: Remove debris from curbs, gutters, corners, and obstacles by reversing the direction of the bristles (only available on 64 and 84 in. brooms)",
      "Flush Sweeping: Get as close as you want. Improved sweeping efficiency allows for flush sweeping to a curb or wall on the right side.",
      "High-Torque Motor: With heavier materials and debris, the high-torque motor allows for maximum power for more efficient sweeping.",
      "Storage Stands: Larger brooms include storage stands to provides maximum uptime protection by eliminating bristle distortion when the broom is not in use. On 68-inch and 84-inch angle broom attachments, the stands use a lever to swing the legs up or down. In the down position the legs are closer to the bristles to make attachment to the machine easier.",
      "Patented Spring Design: Provides optimum down-pressure, extended bristle life and excellent cleaning ability (not available on 48-inch).",

      "Reverse bristle rotation for dustpan sweeping available on the 64 and 84 in. brooms efficiently sweeps leaves, snow, and debris away from corners, curbs, buildings, and obstacles at a lower speed to reduce damage to the cab. Heavy duty bristles have improved wear and better visibility for the operator.",
      "The reversible angle brush is available for all new 400-800 series compact track loaders and skid-steers, as well as Bobcat Toolcats with the 7 Pin Attachment Control Kit.",
      "The angle broom attachment uses a hydraulically-driven, rotating broom that pushes dirt and other debris away from the machine. The angle broom will continuously sweep debris ahead of the machine or angle the broom to windrow material to the side. To easily sweep debris away from obstacles, the broom can reverse direction and pull toward the machine, leaving behind clean corners and angles."

      "Digging Depth Challenge",
      "Sometimes you need to dig deeper to prepare a footing or sump drain, reach stable subsoil or dig below the frost line. If an auger can't dig those extra inches in the hole, it might mean cutting corners or buying an auger extension. Bobcat augers provide design and geometry that helps do the job right. See how other brands compare.",
      "Torque Challenge",
      "With auger attachments, torque equals power. Greater torque makes it easier to break down rock, power through tree roots or clay, and take on frozen ground. All augers have published torque ratings, but performance on the jobsite matters most. The torque challenge video evaluates the difference.",
      "Direct drive augers are ideal for digging holes for posts, piers, poles, or trees.",
      "Planetary augers deliver the power and force needed to dig in anchor applications and through other extreme ground conditions including rock, shale, clay and frost.",
      "Added Digging Depth: Gain an extra foot of dig depth over competitive units because the entire drive unit follows the bit into the hole. Watch the digging depth challenge to see how other brands compare.",
      "Improved Torque: Bobcat® auger attachments deliver greater torque when it matters most. All augers have published torque ratings, but performance on the jobsite matters most. The torque challenge video evaluates the difference.",
      "Direct Drive: Provides optimum balance between torque and RPM. Other brands use a planetary auger drive with more moving parts, greater maintenance needs and higher operating costs. Watch the maintenance comparison video to see for yourself.",
      "Combination Hex and Round Output Shaft: A patented Bobcat technology, the combination output shaft allows for both hex and round bits to be utilized, maximizing parts versatility (models 15C and 30C).",
      "Versatile Mounting System: Easy and efficient for attaching the auger to the carrier. Quickly and easily switch to a variety of multiple carriers.",
      "Unique Knuckle Joint Design: allows the auger to dig vertical holes even if your Bobcat unit is on uneven terrain.",
      "Auger Bits and Teeth: A wide variety to match your digging conditions.",
      "Dig holes with speed and plumb-line accuracy using a Bobcat® auger attachment. Using heavy-duty hydraulics, the auger attachment bites into any soil condition with ease and efficiency. Even in hard and rocky soil, the high torque keeps the auger steady and powerful to maintain performance. Choose between a direct drive auger for an optimum balance between torque and RPM, or a gear-driven planetary auger for applications that require the most torque. Multiple bit types and teeth enable you to find the right auger to match your digging conditions.The direct drive 15 offers a higher range of speed for drilling holes quicker through softer to moderate soil conditions such as sand, dry material, and light dirt so the hole being dug is cleaned out better. The direct drive 30 and the planetary drive augers offer higher amount of torque for digging into heavier ground surfaces such as rocky, coral or clay. With lower speeds to dig, Planetary augers provide the torque needed to install screw anchors and dig with bits that are over 24 inches in diameter.",
      "Direct drive models use a directly mounted hydraulic motor, while planetary models are powered by a gear drive system. The motor turns the output shaft, which is connected to an auger bit to drill into the ground."

      "Digging Depth Challenge",
      "Sometimes you need to dig deeper to prepare a footing or sump drain, reach stable subsoil or dig below the frost line. If an auger can't dig those extra inches in the hole, it might mean cutting corners or buying an auger extension. Bobcat augers provide design and geometry that helps do the job right. See how other brands compare.",
      "Torque Challenge",
      "With auger attachments, torque equals power. Greater torque makes it easier to break down rock, power through tree roots or clay, and take on frozen ground. All augers have published torque ratings, but performance on the jobsite matters most. The torque challenge video evaluates the difference.",
      "Direct drive augers are ideal for digging holes for posts, piers, poles, or trees.",
      "Planetary augers deliver the power and force needed to dig in anchor applications and through other extreme ground conditions including rock, shale, clay and frost.",
      "Added Digging Depth: Gain an extra foot of dig depth over competitive units because the entire drive unit follows the bit into the hole. Watch the digging depth challenge to see how other brands compare.",
      "Improved Torque: Bobcat® auger attachments deliver greater torque when it matters most. All augers have published torque ratings, but performance on the jobsite matters most. The torque challenge video evaluates the difference.",
      "Direct Drive: Provides optimum balance between torque and RPM. Other brands use a planetary auger drive with more moving parts, greater maintenance needs and higher operating costs. Watch the maintenance comparison video to see for yourself.",
      "Combination Hex and Round Output Shaft: A patented Bobcat technology, the combination output shaft allows for both hex and round bits to be utilized, maximizing parts versatility (models 15C and 30C).",
      "Versatile Mounting System: Easy and efficient for attaching the auger to the carrier. Quickly and easily switch to a variety of multiple carriers.",
      "Unique Knuckle Joint Design: allows the auger to dig vertical holes even if your Bobcat unit is on uneven terrain.",
      "Auger Bits and Teeth: A wide variety to match your digging conditions.",
      "Dig holes with speed and plumb-line accuracy using a Bobcat® auger attachment. Using heavy-duty hydraulics, the auger attachment bites into any soil condition with ease and efficiency. Even in hard and rocky soil, the high torque keeps the auger steady and powerful to maintain performance. Choose between a direct drive auger for an optimum balance between torque and RPM, or a gear-driven planetary auger for applications that require the most torque. Multiple bit types and teeth enable you to find the right auger to match your digging conditions.The direct drive 15 offers a higher range of speed for drilling holes quicker through softer to moderate soil conditions such as sand, dry material, and light dirt so the hole being dug is cleaned out better. The direct drive 30 and the planetary drive augers offer higher amount of torque for digging into heavier ground surfaces such as rocky, coral or clay. With lower speeds to dig, Planetary augers provide the torque needed to install screw anchors and dig with bits that are over 24 inches in diameter.",
      "Direct drive models use a directly mounted hydraulic motor, while planetary models are powered by a gear drive system. The motor turns the output shaft, which is connected to an auger bit to drill into the ground."

      "Fingertip Controls: Mounted on the carrier's steering levers, fingertip controls provide quick and easy access to make elevation changes or switch the automatic function on or off, delivering precise and accurate results with maximum operator comfort.",
      "Manual Override Function: While in automatic mode, if the operator pushes a switch to move the blade up or down, automatic mode is momentarily interrupted. When the operator releases the switch the system immediately returns to automatic mode.",
      "Laser Receivers: Deliver a 360-degree operating range. Provide visible indication of where the blade is relative to the ground and an automatic mode indicator.",
      "Increment/Decrement Feature: Move the grade up/down, in 0.1 in. (or 2.5mm) increments up to 2 in. in either direction, making it easier for the operator to make adjustments on-the-fly without leaving the cab to raise or lower the transmitter.",
      "Quick Mounting and Set-up: For ease of use around the jobsite, the laser control system is quickly attached and removed as necessary.",
      "Bobcat® automatic grading solutions deliver more accurate grading results with less time and less labor. Choose from laser-guided systems and sonic/slope systems. Operators will increase their efficiency and reduce fatigue since they can focus on operating the machine's travel, rather than the blade position. Fewer people are also needed because, with near-perfect accuracy, there is no need for a crew to continually check grade on the jobsite. It's as simple as clicking a button on the loader controls to activate the automatic system.With accuracies better than +/-  1/4 \", automatic grade control systems can also save on expensive finishes such as concrete.",
      "A laser transmitter is used to emit a plane of laser light across the job site. The plane mirrors the completed job site and is used as a reference point to ensure the blade is on-grade at all times. The blade moves up and down automatically to keep the base materials on-grade.Laser transmitters and rod-mounted laser receivers can also quickly determine the amount of material that needs to be added or removed from the site.",
      "For a fully equipped laser grading system, Bobcat offers three laser transmitters: one single slope model and two dual slope models. For flatwork or simple grades, a single slope transmitter delivers excellent results. Both models of dual slope transmitters work well for anything from flatwork to compound set-ups. The laser control system increases precision when operating the box blade or grader attachment. Both the box blade and grader work well on flat and single slopes. On dual slopes, the grader attachment delivers increased functionality, with each side of the blade operating independently.",
      "Grader Attachment: Grade surfaces with precision and control while maximizing productivity with the grader attachment. Designed for use in landscaping, asphalt, curb and concrete flatwork, the grader attachment features blades that move six different ways and a front bolster that oscillates 12 degrees to the right or left, allowing for grading on any surface while minimizing the effect of uneven ground. Box Blade Attachment: Control grading operation with the accuracy and durability of the box blade attachment. The box blade incorporates end wings to help carry spoil and features elevation control, which allows the box blade to travel up and down slopes while still delivering accurate results.",
      "BLR2 Receiver: Machine ControlUsing CANbus communication, the BLR2 laser receiver provides frequent updates (up to 20 times per second) to the control valve on the attachment, delivering high accuracy grading. Indicators and an automatic light on the face of the receiver also provide constant information to the operator. To make grade changes quickly from inside the cab, the \"on grade\" setting of the receiver can be moved up or down - up to 2 in. with certain machine options - for fast, accurate results. The laser receiver can also communicate with instrumentation of the loader.Laser TransmittersFor a fully equipped laser grading system, Bobcat offers three laser transmitters: one single slope model and two dual slope models. Each model includes a hand-held laser receiver. All models feature two-way radio remote control to allow adjustments from across the jobsite or from within the machine. All laser transmitters also offer temperature compensation, ensuring the laser beam stays accurate as temperatures change throughout the day. Accuracy on the jobsite is critical, and a quality laser transmitter provides the high accuracy and the quick adjustment features necessary to get the job done right.",
      "On the jobsite, the laser transmitter is mounted on a tripod to provide a 360-degree plane of reference at a set elevation and slope. Laser receivers, mounted on a mast attached to the box blade or grader attachment, capture the light from the laser transmitter. In manual control mode, the receivers inform the operator via LED lights when the blade needs to move up or down, or to notify that the blade is on grade. In automatic control mode, the receiver informs the blade that it needs to move up or down to stay on grade. With the box blade attachment, one receiver - mounted in the middle - moves the entire blade up or down. With the grader attachment, two receivers are mounted so that so each side of the blade will adjust independently."

      "The boring unit attachment saves the time and expense of tearing up sidewalks, driveways and other paved areas. It's an easy way to install underground cables and flexible pipes with little or no damage to existing roads, sidewalks or other existing structures. The hydraulically powered attachment bores horizontally to accommodate pipe or cable up to 4 in. in diameter. After boring, the attachment works to pull the pipe or cable through the hole. The boring unit frame allows the drive head to be mounted, from the front of the loader, in three positions: on the center, right or left side. This allows the attachment to be positioned directly next to obstacles, such as buildings, and be placed exactly where boring operation is desired.",
      "The loader's auxiliary hydraulics power a motor that drives a screw-type boring bit through the ground as the machine is driven forward. The ground is compacted to create a tunnel under the driveway or sidewalk. When the bit reaches the other side, a reaming bit is installed. The loader is backed up and the rotating reaming bit further compacts the soil as it pulls the service through the enlarged tunnel."

      "Adjustable Deflector: Located on the discharge chute, the adjustable deflector reduces the distance chips are thrown from the attachment and deflects the chips into a desired work area, allowing for more control over discharged materials.",
      "Chipper Discharge Chute: Rotates 360-degrees, providing maximum angle position for discharging materials without having to reposition the chipper attachment. Adjustable deflector also helps direct chips in the desired direction.",
      "Chipper Disk: Made from 1.25\" steel, the chipper disk provides heavy-duty strength when cutting heavy material, allowing the chipper attachment to maintain momentum while cutting.",
      "Dual Mounting Locations: Allow the intake housing to be mounted to either the front or right side of the machine, allowing the chipper attachment to accommodate different applications.",
      "Four Tool-Steel Blades: Positioned at different angles, the four blades provide optimum cutting performance while the tool-steel extends blade life. Blades are also reversible for twice the life between sharpening, decreasing maintenance time and maximizing productivity.",
      "Hydraulic Power Feed: Directs branches into the chipper attachment. The operator only needs to get the branches started, meaning overall reduced operator fatigue.",
      "Variable Speed Roller: Gives the operator the ability to set the initial feeding speed as well as distribute power between the feed roller and grinding wheel, providing maximum operator control.",
      "Remote Attachment Control (RAC) Kit: Operator can start the loader from the ground without entering or exiting the loader. Eliminates the need for a second operator in the loader.",
      "Using a powerful disk chipping action, the chipper attachment continuously mulches materials - up to 5-in. in diameter - such as trees, limbs, branches, and saplings. The chipper attachment is ideal for tree removal, pruning services, municipalities, parks and recreation, rentals, and personal property maintenance. Unlike pull-type chippers, the Bobcat® chipper attachment can perform chipping jobs virtually anywhere! The compact design of the chipper attachment can tackle tough terrain. And it operates in any environment where a loader can travel, allowing wood mulching right on site rather than having to haul wood somewhere else.",
      "A hydraulic power feed allows the feed roller to move branches into the chipper at a constant speed. The chipper attachment breaks brush into small chips and discharges the chips through the discharge chute, which can be rotated 360-degrees for maximum angle positioning. Also, the discharged small chips decompose faster than branches or large chips.The 5A chipper features a 5-in. feeder opening and chips material up to 3 in. in diameter. The 8B chipper offers even more versatility, with a 9-in. feeder that chips materials up to 5 in. in diameter."

      "Mulch branches, trees and other debris",
      "Adjustable Deflector: Located on the discharge chute, the adjustable deflector reduces the distance chips are thrown from the attachment and deflects the chips into a desired work area, allowing for more control over discharged materials.",
      "Chipper Discharge Chute: Rotates 360-degrees, providing maximum angle position for discharging materials without having to reposition the chipper attachment. Adjustable deflector also helps direct chips in the desired direction.",
      "Chipper Disk: Made from 1.25\" steel, the chipper disk provides heavy-duty strength when cutting heavy material, allowing the chipper attachment to maintain momentum while cutting.",
      "Dual Mounting Locations: Allow the intake housing to be mounted to either the front or right side of the machine, allowing the chipper attachment to accommodate different applications.",
      "Four Tool-Steel Blades: Positioned at different angles, the four blades provide optimum cutting performance while the tool-steel extends blade life. Blades are also reversible for twice the life between sharpening, decreasing maintenance time and maximizing productivity.",
      "Hydraulic Power Feed: Directs branches into the chipper attachment. The operator only needs to get the branches started, meaning overall reduced operator fatigue.",
      "Variable Speed Roller: Gives the operator the ability to set the initial feeding speed as well as distribute power between the feed roller and grinding wheel, providing maximum operator control.",
      "Remote Attachment Control (RAC) Kit: Operator can start the loader from the ground without entering or exiting the loader. Eliminates the need for a second operator in the loader.",
      "Using a powerful disk chipping action, the chipper attachment continuously mulches materials - up to 5-in. in diameter - such as trees, limbs, branches, and saplings. The chipper attachment is ideal for tree removal, pruning services, municipalities, parks and recreation, rentals, and personal property maintenance. Unlike pull-type chippers, the Bobcat® chipper attachment can perform chipping jobs virtually anywhere! The compact design of the chipper attachment can tackle tough terrain. And it operates in any environment where a loader can travel, allowing wood mulching right on site rather than having to haul wood somewhere else.",
      "A hydraulic power feed allows the feed roller to move branches into the chipper at a constant speed. The chipper attachment breaks brush into small chips and discharges the chips through the discharge chute, which can be rotated 360-degrees for maximum angle positioning. Also, the discharged small chips decompose faster than branches or large chips.The 5A chipper features a 5-in. feeder opening and chips material up to 3 in. in diameter. The 8B chipper offers even more versatility, with a 9-in. feeder that chips materials up to 5 in. in diameter."

      "Adjust the Pro Clamp configuration for the job at hand. Grab large, small or irregular objects with greater grip. You can also follow the bucket farther towards rollout compared to a standard clamp attachment.",

      "Clean up spoil piles quickly with the grading tool and reduce manual labor.",
      "Remove the tool when trenching, giving you enhanced visibility into the trench area.",
      "The Pro Clamp System is available as a factory installed option, and as a dealer-installed accessory for select Bobcat® compact excavators. It is compatible with standard arm and long arm configurations, but cannot be used with the extendable arm option.",
      "Clamp, lift, move and place more debris with the power of the clamp (or thumb) attachment.",
      "Choose from two different clamp styles designed for Bobcat® compact excavators: the Pro Clamp(tm) System or the standard clamp.",
      "The Pro Clamp System expands the usual capabilities of a clamp attachment. As an alternative to a clamp attachment, the Pro Clamp System has a standard pin-on work tool and optional grading tool. Maximize your bucket and clamp setup with the adjustable Pro Clamp System. No tools are required to adjust or remove the work tool.",
      "The Pro Clamp System allows you to:",
      "The standard clamp has a smaller opening compared to the Pro Clamp System, however it has a dual-tooth design which maximizes the clamp capabilities, allowing the attachment to clamp onto many odd-shaped objects and debris. Put the clamp attachment to work with a trenching bucket or three-tine grapple and easily move odd-shaped objects such as tree stumps and broken concrete. The clamp attachment is ideal for moving and removing.",
      "How It Works",
      "Featuring a dual-tooth design, the clamp extends beyond the cutting edge of the bucket for holding objects. When not in use, the clamp retracts fully against the arm of the excavator to prevent interference with possible digging and trenching work.",
      "Compare the two clamp styles to see which works best for your job.",
      "Remove unwanted brush",
      "Available in two sizes, the Pro Clamp includes a base component and a standard pin-on material work tool. Operators may choose the ideal tool position for grabbing large, small or irregular objects.",
      "The optional grading tool can serve as a smooth cutting edge when grading or trenching with a toothed bucket. It can also be reversed to serve as a clamshell when paired with a smooth lip bucket.",
      "The work tool may be removed when trenching. No tools are required to change or remove the work tool."

      "Demolish parking lots, driveways and other large flat concrete slabs",
      "Cushioned Safety Valve: Unique in its industry, the cushioned safety valve allows the operator to stop the hammer in mid-stroke and slowly lower it to a resting position, preventing the hammer from falling if the hydraulic flow is shut off.",
      "Drive Motor: Powers the drop hammer attachment with chain drive.",
      "Effective Breaking Power: Delivering over 3,600 foot pounds of impact energy for quick and efficient demolishing action. The drop hammer features a 38-in. stroke and a hammer weight of 1,165 pounds.",
      "Fast Cycle Time: Delivers a fast cycle time of 20 blows per minute with three seconds between cycles to reposition and reset the loader.",
      "Upright Position: When not in use, the hammer stands upright. Also, stores and transports in the upright position.",
      "Locking Mechanism: Prevents weight from sliding out top of hammer during transport.",
      "Bob-Tach(tm) Mounting System: Makes easy work of attaching and detaching the drop hammer from the loader. Fast and easy mounting means spending less time on attachment changes and more time on the job.",
      "Break and demolish concrete with the drop hammer attachment. To efficiently break up concrete, the drop hammer delivers over 3,600 foot pounds of impact energy combined with a fast cycle time of 20 blows per minute. Upon impact, the drop hammer fractures the material below the surface, leaving the surface free of jagged debris. Between cycles, the drop hammer attachment allows three seconds to reposition and reset the loader. When the attachment is not in use, the hammer stands in the upright position. Compared to standard hydraulic breakers, the drop hammer attachment generates little vibration or noise, meaning less wear on the machine and less noise for the operator and bystanders.",
      "The drop hammer features a chain mechanism with a catch. The catch grabs the weight and raises it up. When the chain rotates over the top, the catch falls and releases the weight, dropping the hammer onto the material to be demolished."

      "Variable Displacement Motor: Allows the flail cutter to be \"tuned in\" to the machine, depending on its hydraulic capacity. A control on the attachment, which connects to the motor, adjusts the hydraulic flow. This makes it possible to use the flail cutter with an assortment of carriers, a feature critical to the rental market. Can be utilized on machines with hydraulic flows ranging from 17 gpm to 40 gpm.",
      "Adjustable Rear Gate: Open or close to vary the size of discharge material; ranging from small (for mulching applications), to coarse (for high-performance cutting).",
      "Automatic Blade Shut-Off Device: When the flail cutter is raised off the ground, this device stops flail rotation preventing debris from being thrown towards the operator.",
      "Floating Linkage (standard): Along with the compact deck length, the flotation linkage allows the flail cutter to float over ground contours, maintaining surface contact for optimal cutting performance.",
      "Full-Width, Adjustable Tapered Rear Roller: Provides greater turning ability during operation, making it easier to maneuver the flail cutter in tight areas.",
      "Safety Compliance: Complies with the SAE J1001 standard for industrial flail mowers.",
      "Thick Steel Deck: Designed with 1/4-in. steel, the deck is designed for maximum strength and durability.",
      "Three Cutting Heights: Allows several options of cutting heights for a variety of terrains and brush types.",
      "Heavy Duty Front Rubber Flap: Helps contain debris.",
      "The flail cutter attachment clears brush and small trees while distributing cut materials evenly. With a cutting width of 79 in., the flail cutter (or flail mower) delivers excellent cutting, mulching, and mowing action for materials up to 3 in. in diameter. The flotation linkage and compact deck length allow the flail cutter to float over ground contours, maintaining surface contact for optimal mowing performance. The thick steel deck design protects the attachment and provides maximum strength for tough clearing jobs. This efficient attachment excels in applications such as agriculture, landscaping, utility, and rental. Other applications include maintenance around personal and lakefront property, construction sites, power lines, road right-of-ways, trails, and other areas needing brush mowing or small tree removal.",
      "Rather than rotate, the hammers cut vertically so cut materials are thrown down on the ground rather than out to the side. This allows cut materials to be spread evenly for a finer finish. The flail cutter attachment can also be operated while traveling in either forward or reverse."

      "A sonic tracer and cross-slope system is available for use with Bobcat's larger grader attachments. Whereas the laser-guided systems require a laser transmitter and can only follow a plane of light, the sonic/slope system will follow the terrain below the sonic tracer (mounted on one side) and maintain a consistent cross-slope that has been predetermined. This system also works well on jobsites in which the transmitter may not have complete visibility to the receivers at all times.",
      "For your most complex design projects, consider the 3D ready system. Using GPS technology or UTS, the system has the ability to accurately and efficiently complete complex designs with accuracy of 3-5 millimeters.",
      "Expand your capabilities and increase your efficiency with the industry's first 3D ready system for compact equipment. Using the plug-and-play system, you'll save time, fuel, and money with millimeter accuracy. Using GPS or UTS, the system has the ability to complete complex design projects including parking lots, sports fields and road work.",
      "Choose between a satellite option for outdoor applications and a universal total station option for indoor applications. After you load a computer-generated model to the loader's control box, the system automatically grades the ground with remarkable accuracy. For you, this means moving dirt to the right spot quicker and getting the job done faster.",
      "With the 3D ready system, you can bring your office and jobsite together. To set it up, simply load a software-generated model file to the CB450 control box. Your loader will take care of the rest. Job progress can be monitored from the office using the Connected Site software. It also gives you the ability to make updates to your designs, wirelessly loading the new model file to your loader on the jobsite in real-time."

      "Dirt Shield: Mounted over the moldboard on larger models, the dirt shield keeps pushed materials moving forward.",
      "Flotation Tires: Provide excellent flotation to keep the grader moving smoothly over the work area.",
      "Side Shift: Manual side shifts on smaller models move the blade up to 12 in. to the left or right. The hydraulic side shift on larger models provides up to 13 in. to the left or right, making it easier to grade next to buildings, poles, and other obstacles.",
      "Oscillating Bolster: Oscillates to the left or right to minimize the effect of uneven ground.",
      "Proportional Hydraulic Valve: Offers three speeds at which the moldboard is raised or lowered, meaning operation can be more closely matched to the speed of the loader. The longer the operator presses the button that controls the valve, the faster the moldboard moves. Also provides finer control with automatic grading solutions.",
      "Bolt-on Reversible Cutting Edge: When the edge wears out it can be flipped over to provide a fresh cutting edge.",
      "Bolt-on End Wing Kit: Helps to carry more material when fine grading or spreading materials such as sand or gravel. Turns the grader into a box blade, eliminating the need for an additional attachment. Option for larger graders.",
      "Automatic Control Systems: Increase accuracy and productivity. Automatically moves the blade up or down to keep the base material exactly on-grade. Grader is 3D laser-ready. Laser control and sonic/cross slope systems are available.",
      "Grade surfaces with precision and control while maximizing productivity with the grader attachment.",
      "The Bobcat® grader attachment excels at high-performance grading. Even delicate tasks can be completed with powerful precision. The grader attachment has a blade that moves six or eight different ways to grade any surface. And the bolster oscillates to minimize the effect of uneven ground, delivering consistent grading performance in a variety of environments.",
      "Achieve a consistent grade with ease and turn your Bobcat loader into a high-performance grading machine with the grader attachment.",
      "Hydraulic cylinders independently adjust each side of the moldboard, angle the moldboard and, on larger models, side shift the moldboard. Tires on the bolster provide excellent flotation to keep the grader moving smoothly over the work area.",
      "Smoother operation and quicker reaction of the grader can be gained when paired with the laser control system. With the laser system, the farther the blade is from grade, the more quickly it will move to grade.",
      "A sonic tracer and cross-slope system is available for use with Bobcat's larger grader attachments. Whereas the laser-guided systems require a laser transmitter and can only follow a plane of light, the sonic/slope system will follow the terrain below the sonic tracer (mounted on one side) and maintain a consistent cross-slope that has been predetermined. This system also works well on jobsites in which the transmitter may not have complete visibility to the receivers at all times.",
      "For your most complex design projects, consider the 3D ready system. Using GPS technology or UTS, the system has the ability to accurately and efficiently complete complex designs with accuracy of 3-5 millimeters.",
      "Expand your capabilities and increase your efficiency with the industry's first 3D ready system for compact equipment. Using the plug-and-play system, you'll save time, fuel, and money with millimeter accuracy. Using GPS or UTS, the system has the ability to complete complex design projects including parking lots, sports fields and road work.",
      "Choose between a satellite option for outdoor applications and a universal total station option for indoor applications. After you load a computer-generated model to the loader's control box, the system automatically grades the ground with remarkable accuracy. For you, this means moving dirt to the right spot quicker and getting the job done faster.",
      "With the 3D ready system, you can bring your office and jobsite together. To set it up, simply load a software-generated model file to the CB450 control box. Your loader will take care of the rest. Job progress can be monitored from the office using the Connected Site software. It also gives you the ability to make updates to your designs, wirelessly loading the new model file to your loader on the jobsite in real-time."

      "Get maximum chomping and ripping power with the root grapple attachment. Built to be the biggest, baddest biter of them all, the root grapple rips into tough jobs with ease. The heavy-duty design improves the wear life of the grapple, especially when operating in tough land clearing jobs. Inertia-welded cylinder ends permit strong, smooth operation by improving hydraulic cushioning. And a curved, skeletal tooth design allows materials to be picked up without driving the teeth into the ground. It's ideal for jobs such as land clearing, landscaping, demolition, construction, rental or buildings and grounds maintenance. Tear it up, bite it off, and spit it out with the root grapple."

While reducing the need for conventional compaction equipment, the packer wheel also promotes on-the-job safety by eliminating the need for a person working in the trench. The compact design of the packer wheel allows it to operate in small areas, increasing the versatility of the carrier. No auxiliary hydraulics are required to operate.",
      "The wheel rolls through the trench using the carrier controls. The weight of the wheel and down pressure from the carrier provides the compacting force. While in the trench, the open rim sheep foot design of the wheel penetrates through the lift of backfill to compact the fill from the bottom up rather than from the top down. This eliminates bridging and voids for better compaction. The depth of the lift can be varied to match moisture content, texture and other soil conditions."

      "Replaceable Ski Wear Pads: Make maintenance easier and more affordable.",
      "Steel Wheels: Mounted on the rear, wheels provide support and reduce tire bounce for a smoother cut.",
      "Side Cutting Teeth: Decreases drum binding in the cut for smoother operation and provides a vertical edge for improving the joint bond between new and existing road layers.",
      "Free Floating Oscillation: The cutting wheel oscillates side to side to provide optimum surface tracking regardless of loader movements, so even if the loader tires fall into a hole or depression it will cut evenly. With the Bobcat planer, pavement milling is a controlled process as the depth, width, and slope are easily set and controlled by the operator.",
      "Hydraulic Side Shift: Side shifting allows milling outside the width of the carrier, making possible flush cutting adjacent to curbs and walls.",
      "Large Rear Opening: Reduces the amount of material being re-milled, increasing productivity because more material can be removed from the planer before it is reground into smaller pieces.",
      "Removable End Plate: As the only manufacturer of this feature, Bobcat allows the planer to mill flush against wall with no further clean-up work required.",
      "Visible Left Ski: Keeps the planer centered and provides easier control over its path.",

      "Planer Drum: One-piece concentric unit made for better durability and smooth cutting.",
      "Priority Valve: Diverts oil to depth function without causing momentary loss of power to planer drum, allowing the operator to make adjustments on-the-go without sacrificing cutting power.",
      "Independently Adjustable Skis: Fingertip controls from the operator's seat provide depth and angle control for a consistent-depth cut. Also, skis push debris away, keeping the skids in contact with the cutting surface.",
      "Diverter Valve: Allows the operator to switch between hydraulic side-shift and hydraulic oscillation functions.",
      "Front Access Panel: To inspect and replace cutting bits, a front access panel allows for easy inspection and saves maintenance time.",
      "Two Direct-Drive Motors: With one on each side of the drum, the two motors increase torque force which provides an increase in productivity and life of the planer.",
      "Cut and mill concrete and asphalt with the controlled removal process of the planer attachment. The milling process involves low angle, high velocity blows in a controlled pattern that uniformly chips pavement. Depth, width, and slope control are easily set and maintained by the operator. Milled material can be immediately recycled, nicely finishing any asphalt and repair jobs. The Bobcat® planer attachment is much less expensive to maintain and more maneuverable than dedicated planers. The planer attachment is versatile and durable, delivering high torque for maximum cutting and milling performance. Choose from four different planer models listed below.Standard flow planer provides excellent performance on standard flow machines allowing a lower initial investment for those that only need to use a planer periodically. High flow planers utilize the increased hydraulic horsepower available for high production needs.",
      "Carbide-tipped bits are mounted on a revolving drum to cut and pulverize pavement material. After material has been milled, it leaves the planer housing through a rear opening. Planer skis are used to adjust the angle and depth by moving the right and left ski up or down. Depth gauges are visible from the cab to provide a measurement reference of each ski depth. Bobcat planers have better visibility of the skis, so operators can easily control the path of the planer and the machine. Even on rough terrain, the planer skis maintain surface contact, resulting in a consistent cut depth.",

Unlike broadcast seeders, the seeder attachment is a ground-driven unit that seeds directly into the soil for better germination and more accurate coverage. Front rollers firm and press small rocks below the surface while also pressing seed into the seedbed. Rear rollers split the shallow ridges and gently form the soil around the seed, ensuring optimum seed-to-soil contact. This action eliminates broadcasting seed into unwanted areas such as flowerbeds and walkways. At a production rate of more than 2 acres per hour, the seeder attachment gets the job done quickly and efficiently. Can be front mounted on a loader or Toolcat(tm) machine, or rear mounted on a 3-pt. hitch.",

Side shift function is accomplished manually. (Note: A Bob-Tach(tm) mounting system to 3-point adapter must be used to attach to loaders.)",
      "Install silt fence on residential, commercial and industrial construction projects, and highway projects.",
      "Blade Pivot: When installing a fence, the blade on the silt fence installer pivots relative to the frame for maximum turning ability.",

      "Coulter Wheel: Slices turf, roots, and more to assist the blade in ground penetration, delivering maximum installer performance and productivity.",
      "Prop Stands: Provide easy, 3-point hitch mounting for quick attaching.",
      "Replaceable Tooth: Easily penetrates the ground, helping to pull the blade directly into the soil when placing the fence. Tooth is replaceable for easy and affordable maintenance.",
      "Quick-Threading Installer: Load the fabric into the quick-threading installer by pulling it down under the installer's guide rod and pulling through the chute.",
      "Spring-Loaded End Cap: When working hard on job, the spring-loaded end cap acts as a brake to keep the fence roll from unintentionally unrolling.",

      "Install a more secure silt fence faster and easier with the silt fence installer attachment. Meet erosion control regulations and avoid costly fines. The silt fence installer is the fastest, easiest, and most economical way to install silt fence. Simply load the fabric into the quick-threading installer, roll into the ground and drive - the silt fence unrolls itself. A quick change cap - mounted on the end of the silt fence installer - includes a spring-loaded plate which ensures proper tension on the fence roll, keeping the roll from accidentally unwinding while on the job. And the coulter wheel slices through the turf and roots of the working environment. Increase productivity by installing thousands of feet of silt fence per hour while avoiding fines and project shutdowns.Mounting Options",
      "The operator threads the silt fence under a rod and through the chute on the blade. The blade is positioned for optimum fence placement and the attachment is lowered into the ground. As the machine is driven, the silt fence unrolls automatically. When beginning to install a fence, the centering springs work to keep the blade straight, allowing for accurate placement. The fence is cut when finished."

      "Blades angle 30 degrees to either side to help move snow where you want it. The blade angle is adjusted from the cab by a fingertip control, which allows the operator to adjust the blade without removing hands from the loader steering levers. The blade oscillates five degrees to keep in contact with the surface, preventing the need for multiple passes to clear snow. Damage to snow blade components is prevented if the snow blade contacts sections of raised concrete on sidewalks or other obstructions. Standard snow blades feature a trip moldboard and heavy duty snow blades feature a trip edge.High visibility masts at each end of the moldboard to help keep operators aware of the blade corners. Additionally, since most snow is cleared at night or in the early morning, when it is dark. The heavy duty snow blades also offer 5 degrees of oscillation to either side that help keep the cutting edge moving snow around drainage in parking lots and transitions from sidewalks to streets. Optional features include rubber or polyurethane cutting edges and end-wing kits. The end-wing kits make the attachment more versatile by allowing the snow blade to also be used as a snow pusher."

      "Abrasion-Resistant Skid Shoes: Deliver powerful snow pushing results. Also, abrasion-resistant feature provides maximum uptime protection.",
      "Blade Flotation and Oscillation: Free-floating blade movement offers lift, tilt and oscillation to keep the moldboard in contact with the surface across the width of the blade. Protects against surface damage while cleanly removing snow from uneven surfaces. Also, blade flotation extends skid shoe life by limiting excessive down-pressure when removing snow from irregular surfaces.",
      "Cutting Edge Support: Rear support on the cutting edge provides additional strength to the moldboard.",
      "End Wings: Keep snow within the width of the attachment and prevent snow from spilling over the sides, eliminating additional cleanup on the jobsite.",
      "Exterior Gusseting: Reduces snow build-up inside the boxed blade, allowing for more snow collecting and pushing power with fewer stops.",
      "Rubber Cutting Edge: For optimum surface protection, rubber cutting edges deliver pushing power while protecting sensitive surfaces. Polyurethane cutting edges also available.",
      "Bob-Tach(tm) Attachment Mounting System: Turns any carrier into a multi-job machine with a tight-fit attachment hook-up. Fast and easy attachment changes mean spending less time attaching and more time on the job.",
      "Tri-formed box for strength: The moldboard has a plow structure like no other in its class. The full length tri-formed box structure gives it the most torque resistance and rigidity. Designs like this have been used in the highway plows for years. The moldboard sheet itself is 10ga grade 50 steel which has a higher tensile strength, making it harder to dent and tear, prolonging the life of the finish and plow itself.",
      "Heavy duty powder coating: Powder coat and primer baked at 400+ degrees safeguards all of the steel components and keeps the blade looking great for years. A method of applying seam sealer to all un-welded joints prior to the finish getting baked on eliminates rust marks and substantially increases the life and appearance of the entire finish.",
      "9\" plow blade trip edge: The Blade features a tall, 9'' safety trip-edge which prevents accidental damage when encountering hidden obstacles by tripping back 68 degrees. Powered by four compression style return springs and pivoting on 7 total 1 inch trip pins, it trips when you need it, and stays put when you don't.",
      "Effective plow angle: The attack angle is at 65 degrees so that it scrapes cleanly - forward and backwards. Mounted onto the trip edge is a high carbon steel cutting edge, 6 inches tall, 5/8 inches thick. Angle plowing with a skid steer at low speed is efficient, and it's made even better with the 35 degree max angle that the plow can achieve. This is often more productive and efficient than plowing with trucks.",
      "Replaceable plow cutting edge: Our cutting edges meet highway department standards, and will fit up with any 'standard highway punch' design, available almost anywhere. No one can afford downtime during a storm, so just replace the edge as needed - no need to move, rotate, flip or flop",
      "Protective sleeves and advanced couplers on the hydraulic system: Protective sleeves are added to all of the hoses. Next we include an advanced male and female coupling that will connect by hand with residual pressure of 300 bar or 2900 psi locked in the hydraulic circuit which will connect with residual pressure without releasing any fluid into the environment. This robust system complements the rugged features and operation of this system in any environment the most extreme winter can produce.",
      "Blade oscillation: Prevents situations when your blade doesn't stay flat on the plowing surface, whether due to uneven pavement or improper boom adjustment. The blade stays flat on the plowing surface from tip to tip whether fully angled or straight, even with down pressure applied.",
      "Transform simple blade into box plow: So simple, yet so genius. The simple design of the box gives it a durable structure that overcomes the destructive tendencies so many snow removal operations can produce.",
      "Flexible polyurethane skids: Polyurethane skids are flexible, rather than rigid steel shoes, reducing any bending or denting. They also feature 4 slots in the rear that allow the skid to self-adjust upwards as the cutting edge of the plow becomes worn. This ensures that the plow is always scraping and cleaning like it should.",
      "Low maintenance: Every detail of the box flows right into the overall theme of low maintenance and simplicity. The polyurethane bumpers protect the finish, while the pre-punched 10 inch wide snow catches prevent spillage while pushing.",
      "Replaceable side panels: Easy to bolt on in case of replacement and come standard.",
      "Collect and push snow - and clear big-time winter jobs - with the snow pusher attachment.The open bottom and wide body deliver pure pushing power, for maximum snow removal speed and efficiency. And with more collecting and holding capabilities, larger areas can be cleaned without stopping as often. Flotation and oscillation of the moldboard keep the snow pusher in contact with the ground without damaging equipment or property, allowing for snow removal over decorative and sensitive surfaces.When operating on terrain that isn't perfectly flat, allow the blade to float for following ground contours and collecting more snow. When powering through snow on flat surfaces, keep blade position fixed for clearing hard-packed snow and ice.",
      "When a heavy snow is slowing you down, the BobcatR Snow Pusher Pro will help you make light work of a tough job. Built for the efficiency of a commercial snow remover, this attachment has both an angle snow blade and a snow pusher all in one for maximum effectiveness. 3 different sizes are compatible with most Bobcat Compact Track Loaders and Skid-Steer Loaders. Available in 96in., 108in., and 120in. Widths.This attachment is compatible with the following models: S595, S640, S650, S740, S770, S850, T595, T630, T650, T740, T770, T870Also compatible with S550, S570, S590,T550, T590 with the optional 200lb. counterweight sold separately."

    "features": [
      "Clear parking lots, driveways, and building sites",
      "Push snow from paving stones, decorative concrete, and sloped sidewalks",
      "Abrasion-Resistant Skid Shoes: Deliver powerful snow pushing results. Also, abrasion-resistant feature provides maximum uptime protection.",
      "Blade Flotation and Oscillation: Free-floating blade movement offers lift, tilt and oscillation to keep the moldboard in contact with the surface across the width of the blade. Protects against surface damage while cleanly removing snow from uneven surfaces. Also, blade flotation extends skid shoe life by limiting excessive down-pressure when removing snow from irregular surfaces.",
      "Cutting Edge Support: Rear support on the cutting edge provides additional strength to the moldboard.",
      "End Wings: Keep snow within the width of the attachment and prevent snow from spilling over the sides, eliminating additional cleanup on the jobsite.",
      "Exterior Gusseting: Reduces snow build-up inside the boxed blade, allowing for more snow collecting and pushing power with fewer stops.",
      "Rubber Cutting Edge: For optimum surface protection, rubber cutting edges deliver pushing power while protecting sensitive surfaces. Polyurethane cutting edges also available.",
      "Bob-Tach(tm) Attachment Mounting System: Turns any carrier into a multi-job machine with a tight-fit attachment hook-up. Fast and easy attachment changes mean spending less time attaching and more time on the job.",
      "Tri-formed box for strength: The moldboard has a plow structure like no other in its class. The full length tri-formed box structure gives it the most torque resistance and rigidity. Designs like this have been used in the highway plows for years. The moldboard sheet itself is 10ga grade 50 steel which has a higher tensile strength, making it harder to dent and tear, prolonging the life of the finish and plow itself.",
      "Heavy duty powder coating: Powder coat and primer baked at 400+ degrees safeguards all of the steel components and keeps the blade looking great for years. A method of applying seam sealer to all un-welded joints prior to the finish getting baked on eliminates rust marks and substantially increases the life and appearance of the entire finish.",
      "9\" plow blade trip edge: The Blade features a tall, 9'' safety trip-edge which prevents accidental damage when encountering hidden obstacles by tripping back 68 degrees. Powered by four compression style return springs and pivoting on 7 total 1 inch trip pins, it trips when you need it, and stays put when you don't.",
      "Effective plow angle: The attack angle is at 65 degrees so that it scrapes cleanly - forward and backwards. Mounted onto the trip edge is a high carbon steel cutting edge, 6 inches tall, 5/8 inches thick. Angle plowing with a skid steer at low speed is efficient, and it's made even better with the 35 degree max angle that the plow can achieve. This is often more productive and efficient than plowing with trucks.",
      "Replaceable plow cutting edge: Our cutting edges meet highway department standards, and will fit up with any 'standard highway punch' design, available almost anywhere. No one can afford downtime during a storm, so just replace the edge as needed - no need to move, rotate, flip or flop",
      "Protective sleeves and advanced couplers on the hydraulic system: Protective sleeves are added to all of the hoses. Next we include an advanced male and female coupling that will connect by hand with residual pressure of 300 bar or 2900 psi locked in the hydraulic circuit which will connect with residual pressure without releasing any fluid into the environment. This robust system complements the rugged features and operation of this system in any environment the most extreme winter can produce.",
      "Blade oscillation: Prevents situations when your blade doesn't stay flat on the plowing surface, whether due to uneven pavement or improper boom adjustment. The blade stays flat on the plowing surface from tip to tip whether fully angled or straight, even with down pressure applied.",
      "Transform simple blade into box plow: So simple, yet so genius. The simple design of the box gives it a durable structure that overcomes the destructive tendencies so many snow removal operations can produce.",
      "Flexible polyurethane skids: Polyurethane skids are flexible, rather than rigid steel shoes, reducing any bending or denting. They also feature 4 slots in the rear that allow the skid to self-adjust upwards as the cutting edge of the plow becomes worn. This ensures that the plow is always scraping and cleaning like it should.",
      "Low maintenance: Every detail of the box flows right into the overall theme of low maintenance and simplicity. The polyurethane bumpers protect the finish, while the pre-punched 10 inch wide snow catches prevent spillage while pushing.",
      "Replaceable side panels: Easy to bolt on in case of replacement and come standard.",
      "Collect and push snow - and clear big-time winter jobs - with the snow pusher attachment.The open bottom and wide body deliver pure pushing power, for maximum snow removal speed and efficiency. And with more collecting and holding capabilities, larger areas can be cleaned without stopping as often. Flotation and oscillation of the moldboard keep the snow pusher in contact with the ground without damaging equipment or property, allowing for snow removal over decorative and sensitive surfaces.When operating on terrain that isn't perfectly flat, allow the blade to float for following ground contours and collecting more snow. When powering through snow on flat surfaces, keep blade position fixed for clearing hard-packed snow and ice.",
      "When a heavy snow is slowing you down, the BobcatR Snow Pusher Pro will help you make light work of a tough job.

      "Throw and blow snow to clear a clean path - even through deep drifts - with the snowblower attachment. Use the rotating chute and deflector to bank snow high or throw it far. Chute rotation is achieved by a chain and sprocket system that eliminates loose, tangled, and frozen cables. By adjusting the deflector up or down, the chute points snow in almost any direction and throws snow wherever the operator wants it to be placed. Blow snow off driveways and parking lots, even tight spaces like sidewalks. With the optional truck loading chute, place snow high into the truck and simplify hauling. Toss snow even in hard-to-reach places such as the middle of lawns, ditches, or wooded areas alongside a path. Whatever the conditions - deep snow banks, hard, compacted snow, or heavy snowfall - the snowblower attachment is the ultimate workhorse of snow removal. High flow models capture the increased available hydraulic horsepower to power through the deepest drifts, the heaviest snow and throw it farther.The snowblower attachment is the ideal winter clean-up tool, especially for homeowners with acreage and grounds maintenance crews."

By adjusting the deflector up or down, the chute points snow in almost any direction and throws snow wherever the operator wants it to be placed. Blow snow off driveways and parking lots, even tight spaces like sidewalks. With the optional truck loading chute, place snow high into the truck and simplify hauling. Toss snow even in hard-to-reach places such as the middle of lawns, ditches, or wooded areas alongside a path. Whatever the conditions - deep snow banks, hard, compacted snow, or heavy snowfall - the snowblower attachment is the ultimate workhorse of snow removal. High flow models capture the increased available hydraulic horsepower to power through the deepest drifts, the heaviest snow and throw it farther.The snowblower attachment is the ideal winter clean-up tool, especially for homeowners with acreage and grounds maintenance crews."

      "By using direct power provided from the PTO on your 3650 UTV, the snowblower easily cuts through and tosses deep snow. A large 12-inch-diameter auger provides plenty of capacity to make short work of snow removal. Bobcat snowblowers are easy to use, simple to maintain and will blow as much snow as you can push into them.",
      "Height adjustment and chute rotation are hydraulically operated and controlled by a joystick from inside the cab. The ability to raise the blower off of the ground makes clearing deep snow or cutting through banks easier. Cut through packed snow by lowering the blower below grade to allow for additional weight to be exerted on the cutting edge. Toss snow in hard-to-reach places such as the middle of lawns, ditches or wooded areas alongside a path.",
      "The snowblower attachment is the ideal winter cleanup tool, especially for homeowners with acreage and grounds maintenance crews."

      "Built for easy and efficient soil preparation, the 3-point tiller implement quickly turns a backyard plot into a soil bed for gardening. It's perfect for cultivating, aerating and stirring up soil for gardens, food plots and other tillage needs. This compact tractor implement can be switched between forward or reverse rotation, allowing top-cutting and under-cutting in either direction. Adjustable runners allow you to till soil up to 7 inches deep, and each flange includes six tines for more efficient digging with less vibration. Oil-bath lubrication with an all-gear-driven driveline delivers better performance and less maintenance. Designed to work closer to buildings, fences and trees.",

      "Self-Sharpening Heat-Treated Tines: Save time and money by maintaining sharp edges even after tearing through hard, rocky terrain.",
      "Tilling Depth Adjustment: Adjustable runners offer depth control with up to 7-inch tilling depth for maximum mixture of all layers of the soil and more precise tilling operation.",
      "Six Tines Per Flange: For more efficient digging and less vibration.",
      "Category 1 3-Point Hitch: A 3-point hitch is used to attach your rear-mounted tiller implement. An adjustable top link is centered above 2 lower link arms, comprising the 3 points. The tiller implement quickly and easily attaches with connecting pins at each point.",
      "Durable, Corrosion-Resistant Powder-Coat Finish: Protects the tiller for extra-long life out in the elements.",
      "Heavy-Duty PTO Shaft and Slip Clutch: PTO shaft is designed for various sizes of tractors. Slip clutch protects the gearbox from damage.",
      "The tiller is a power take-off (PTO) driven implement, so it does not require its own engine or motor. The PTO transfers the power from the compact tractor engine to the tiller. You simply attach the tiller to the 3-point hitch and engage the PTO shaft to the tractor. The tiller tines rotate in the opposite direction as the tires when the tractor is moving forward and cover the tire tracks for a consistent finish, eliminating tiller side-shifting, and reducing the need for more than one pass to complete the work. It is important to know if your tractor offers independent PTO or live PTO when engaging your implement. Please read the owner's manual thoroughly.",
      "Choose the Bobcat® compact tractor tiller implement that is optimized for the appropriate PTO horsepower of your compact tractor. You want the PTO horsepower of the tractor to be higher than required to run the implement."

The large, wheel-type compactor compresses soil down in the trench, using a vibratory shaker box for optimum compaction in any soil type. To ensure proper RPM, the vibratory shaker box features a built-in flow regulator. The trench compactor attachment works most efficiently in trenches four to 12 in. wide, and up to four feet deep. Power into the soil and pack it down with force. For trenches that are more than two feet deep, backfill and compact the soil in two or three layers to achieve desired compaction. This attachment is ideal for locations such as backyards, golf courses, and parks. It finishes off any trenching job, working to power down and compress the soil for a neatly-packed trench."

Designed for mini track loaders, the vibratory plow attachment is the ideal tool for installing pipe and cable with minimal ground disturbance. Dig down with the adjustable plow blade, available in either pull or chute configurations. To preserve surrounding sod conditions, a coulter wheel cuts sod immediately ahead of the plow blade while the pressure foot holds the sod down as the blade moves up and down. The result is a knife-like slit that almost disappears as the cut is driven over by the machine. The vibratory plow is the ideal attachment for landscaping and utility contractors looking to expand jobsite versatility of their mini track loader machines.",

Cable grips are also available-in up to three sizes-for attaching to the blade and pulling the wire through the ground.

      "Paving, patching, trenching and flatwork",
      "Sand, pea rock, gravel, and asphalt patching: Choose a smooth drum.",
      "Heavy soils, clay, and clay-based backfill compaction: Choose a padded drum.",
      "Bi-Directional Operation: Dual-direction vibration motor permits compaction while traveling in either direction.",
      "Drum Oscillation: Free drum oscillation keeps more of the drum in contact with the surface on uneven terrain.",
      "Isolation Mounting System: Reduces vibration transferred to theoperator, meaning less operator fatigue and more comfortable working conditions. Also, affords more consistent pressure to the ground, delivering constant compacting results.",
      "Offset Drum Design: Allows the right side of roller to extend past the machine for compacting next to sidewalks, walls, or curbs.",
      "Oil-Bath Bearings: Designed to avoid costly downtime, the oil-bath bearings eliminate the need for daily greasing.",
      "Protected Hose Routing: Maximizes uptime and keeps couplers clean.",
      "Scrapers: Keep the drum clean for better ground contact and compaction.",
      "Versatility: Depending the jobsite, choose between a smooth or padded drum.",
      "Bob-Tach® Mounting System: Turns any loader into a multi-job machine with a tight-fit attachment hook-up. Fast and easy attachment changes means spending less time on maintenance and more time on the job.",
      "Get ready to tackle uneven terrain and big jobs with the vibratory roller attachment.The vibratory roller hard-packs in either forward or reverse. Oscillation of the drum allows the roller to follow contours on uneven terrain, offering more precise control when operating on slopes. For more compact jobsites, the offset drum design allows for operating next to sidewalks, walls, and curbs. Designed for greater operator comfort, the isolation mounting system reduces vibration transferred to the operator, meaning less operator fatigue and more comfortable working conditions and a more packed jobsite.It is the ideal attachment for site preparation operations, landscaping contractors, and paving operations. Easy to haul over the road, the vibratory roller is an agile jobsite attachment, delivering faster results in fewer passes.",
      "The vibrating action of the roller allows the base material to realign and compact from the bottom up. A hydraulic motor drives a centrifugal weight on the drum shaft that provides the compacting action."
