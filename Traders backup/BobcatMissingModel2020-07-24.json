      "description": "The vertical-lift-path T76 compact track loader, part of the revolutionary R-Series loader lineup, has been completely redesigned to meet the growing demands of today's toughest jobsites. The 74-hp loader - sometimes referred to as a skid-steer with tracks - boasts an inline engine and direct-drive system as well as cast-steel lift arms and an optimized lift arm linkage to increase lift height and capacity. The loader's low ground pressure track system gives operators the ability to push through soft, sandy, wet or muddy conditions. You'll notice powerful hydraulics and breakout forces, fast cycle times and an emphasis on operator comfort with optional automatic heat and air conditioning, ergonomic controls and a roomy cab. The advanced 5-Link torsion suspension undercarriage - another option on R-Series loaders - provides a more comfortable ride on long working days while enhanced features make servicing the machine even easier. The T76 is optimized to deliver more usable horsepower and better overall performance so you can complete bigger jobs in less time.",

      "description": "The Bobcat® MT55 mini track loader tackles big jobs in close quarters with impressive traction and lifting abilities. It turns quickly in its tracks, treads lightly over soft ground and provides endless work-saving opportunities. The MT55 can complete a long list of jobs. Use it for trenching, digging, carrying materials, demolition, site preparation, snow removal, utility installation, sweeping, stump grinding and more. Equip the MT55 with either the Common Industry Interface (CII) or the exclusive Bob-Tach® mounting system. The Common Industry Interface design allows you to pair the MT55 with many attachments you may already own and use, while the Bob-Tach mounting system delivers rapid attachment changes and superior attachment fitment.Walk behind the MT55 or choose the optional ride-on platform that attaches quickly and easily. Used by itself or as a complement to bigger loaders, the MT55 excels as a work-saver.",

It goes through gates, doorways and other narrow spaces with ease. The machine also delivers a big boost in power with a 1,000-lb. rated operating capacity, powerful breakout force and impressive lift height. The optimized roller spacing on the MT100's track system improves ride quality for enhanced operator comfort and confidence when working long days. Easy, tool-free access to maintenance areas and advanced safety features, including neutral start interlocks, are standard on the MT100 mini track loader, while permanently sealed rollers eliminate the need for daily roller maintenance and decrease downtime. Powered by a dependable, durable Tier 4 diesel engine, this mini track loader uses an efficient hydraulic system to deliver fast cycle times and increased strength when working with big loads. This loader also features high-flotation tracks that allow it to move across wet and muddy ground conditions with less worry about repair time and costs associated with surface damage.The MT100 makes tight jobsites easy to navigate thanks to its ergonomically designed ISO joystick controls. Plus, the dedicated ride-on platform gives you a wider view to the sides and the bucket cutting edge or attachment while keeping you above surface conditions as you work. Pair your MT100 with a range of compatible mini track loader attachments to tackle trenching, digging, carrying materials, demolition, site preparation, snow removal, utility installation, sweeping, stump grinding and more.",

      "description": "The E42 compact (mini) excavator offers enhanced hydraulic performance, improved efficiency and more precise control so you can push the limits and take on more complex work. The E42 is an R2-Series excavator and features a redesigned Bobcat® engine that improves performance, simplifies maintenance and maximizes uptime. Configure it with the optional long arm or extendable arm to increase your dig depth and reduce the frequency of repositioning the machine. Standard features include low-effort joysticks that respond easily to operator input, an improved cooling system to control engine compartment temperature and a larger slew bearing with improved durability. An optimized hydraulic control valve gives operators improved metering, finite movement and controllability for level grading. Plus, the conventional tail swing is well-balanced for better lift capacity and increased operator confidence. Additional options include a state-of-the-art touch display, angle blade and a rear camera for maximum visibility and productivity.",

It delivers leading lift capacity, four power modes and fast cycle times. An ideal combination of machine weight, power and capacity takes performance in heavy digging and lifting operations to the next level. The reduced tail swing allows for greater maneuverability in tight jobsites, so you can confidently work around obstacles or against walls.Class-leading hydraulics provide reliable, steady power to the E145 excavator work group, saving time with every digging cycle. More slewing torque means more power for slewing uphill, backfilling and all-around better productivity.The E145 large excavator offers a variety of comfort features, including generous floor space, a pressurized cab with sound-isolating seal, heated seat and automotive-style heating and air conditioning. This machine is easy to service with wide-open access panels, a hinged belly pan and centralized grease banks to make essential daily maintenance quick and easy. Side and rearview cameras are standard on the E145 excavator.",

This 39.9-hp utility vehicle, also known as a side-by-side UTV, offers seating for six people and includes a 1,000cc, two-cylinder SOHC engine that delivers high-performance power, maximum reliability, durability, plus gas-engine convenience. The large, 900-watt stator provides about 75 amps of output for use with the snow blade and other electric-powered accessories, while the electronic fuel injection offers the best starting performance in all seasons. A large cargo box with a durable composite interior stands up to tough cargo and materials, retaining its strength (and good looks) for years. All that, plus the Bobcat® UV34XL offers all-wheel drive, convenient service access, improved ground clearance and increased tow rating - just what your toughest projects demand.",

      "description": "The strong, versatile V923 VersaHANDLER® telescopic tool carrier is ideal for projects that require increased lift height, reach and capacity. This Bobcat® telehandler, in the 9,000-10,000 lb. size class, delivers many of the same functions of a wheel loader, an attachment carrier and a rough-terrain forklift - moving, lifting and dumping heavy materials. Featuring a 130-hp turbocharged Bobcat engine and heavy-duty drive train, the V923 telehandler offers an increased rated lift capacity of 9,000 pounds for more productivity with every lift cycle and unbeatable pushing strength. A Z-Bar boom linkage delivers greater range of bucket rotation, an increased dump angle at full height and increased breakout force to lift material out of a pile and dump it easily. Operators get increased visibility around the machine with the low-profile boom and wrap-around rear window. Added comfort features, such as the automatic air suspension seat and suspended cab are designed to improve ride quality and keep operators comfortable during a long day's work. Plus, the side-mounted engine, remote oil filters, easily adjustable boom guides, simple cooling system cleanout and double-element air filter make it quick and convenient to service the machine. Use a variety of telehandler attachments on the telescoping boom and get the most challenging jobs off the ground.",
