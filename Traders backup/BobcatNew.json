      "description": "The vertical-lift-path T76 compact track loader, part of the revolutionary R-Series loader lineup, has been completely redesigned to meet the growing demands of today's toughest jobsites. The 74-hp loader - sometimes referred to as a skid-steer with tracks - boasts an inline engine and direct-drive system as well as cast-steel lift arms and an optimized lift arm linkage to increase lift height and capacity. The loader's low ground pressure track system gives operators the ability to push through soft, sandy, wet or muddy conditions. You'll notice powerful hydraulics and breakout forces, fast cycle times and an emphasis on operator comfort with optional automatic heat and air conditioning, ergonomic controls and a roomy cab. The advanced 5-Link torsion suspension undercarriage - another option on R-Series loaders - provides a more comfortable ride on long working days while enhanced features make servicing the machine even easier. The T76 is optimized to deliver more usable horsepower and better overall performance so you can complete bigger jobs in less time.",

      "description": "The Bobcat速 MT55 mini track loader tackles big jobs in close quarters with impressive traction and lifting abilities. It turns quickly in its tracks, treads lightly over soft ground and provides endless work-saving opportunities. The MT55 can complete a long list of jobs. Use it for trenching, digging, carrying materials, demolition, site preparation, snow removal, utility installation, sweeping, stump grinding and more. Equip the MT55 with either the Common Industry Interface (CII) or the exclusive Bob-Tach速 mounting system. The Common Industry Interface design allows you to pair the MT55 with many attachments you may already own and use, while the Bob-Tach mounting system delivers rapid attachment changes and superior attachment fitment.Walk behind the MT55 or choose the optional ride-on platform that attaches quickly and easily. Used by itself or as a complement to bigger loaders, the MT55 excels as a work-saver.",

It goes through gates, doorways and other narrow spaces with ease. The machine also delivers a big boost in power with a 1,000-lb. rated operating capacity, powerful breakout force and impressive lift height. The optimized roller spacing on the MT100's track system improves ride quality for enhanced operator comfort and confidence when working long days. Easy, tool-free access to maintenance areas and advanced safety features, including neutral start interlocks, are standard on the MT100 mini track loader, while permanently sealed rollers eliminate the need for daily roller maintenance and decrease downtime. Powered by a dependable, durable Tier 4 diesel engine, this mini track loader uses an efficient hydraulic system to deliver fast cycle times and increased strength when working with big loads. This loader also features high-flotation tracks that allow it to move across wet and muddy ground conditions with less worry about repair time and costs associated with surface damage.The MT100 makes tight jobsites easy to navigate thanks to its ergonomically designed ISO joystick controls. Plus, the dedicated ride-on platform gives you a wider view to the sides and the bucket cutting edge or attachment while keeping you above surface conditions as you work. Pair your MT100 with a range of compatible mini track loader attachments to tackle trenching, digging, carrying materials, demolition, site preparation, snow removal, utility installation, sweeping, stump grinding and more.",

      "description": "The E42 compact (mini) excavator offers enhanced hydraulic performance, improved efficiency and more precise control so you can push the limits and take on more complex work. The E42 is an R2-Series excavator and features a redesigned Bobcat速 engine that improves performance, simplifies maintenance and maximizes uptime. Configure it with the optional long arm or extendable arm to increase your dig depth and reduce the frequency of repositioning the machine. Standard features include low-effort joysticks that respond easily to operator input, an improved cooling system to control engine compartment temperature and a larger slew bearing with improved durability. An optimized hydraulic control valve gives operators improved metering, finite movement and controllability for level grading. Plus, the conventional tail swing is well-balanced for better lift capacity and increased operator confidence. Additional options include a state-of-the-art touch display, angle blade and a rear camera for maximum visibility and productivity.",

It delivers leading lift capacity, four power modes and fast cycle times. An ideal combination of machine weight, power and capacity takes performance in heavy digging and lifting operations to the next level. The reduced tail swing allows for greater maneuverability in tight jobsites, so you can confidently work around obstacles or against walls.Class-leading hydraulics provide reliable, steady power to the E145 excavator work group, saving time with every digging cycle. More slewing torque means more power for slewing uphill, backfilling and all-around better productivity.The E145 large excavator offers a variety of comfort features, including generous floor space, a pressurized cab with sound-isolating seal, heated seat and automotive-style heating and air conditioning. This machine is easy to service with wide-open access panels, a hinged belly pan and centralized grease banks to make essential daily maintenance quick and easy. Side and rearview cameras are standard on the E145 excavator.",

      "description": "The strong, versatile V923 VersaHANDLER速 telescopic tool carrier is ideal for projects that require increased lift height, reach and capacity. This Bobcat速 telehandler, in the 9,000-10,000 lb. size class, delivers many of the same functions of a wheel loader, an attachment carrier and a rough-terrain forklift - moving, lifting and dumping heavy materials. Featuring a 130-hp turbocharged Bobcat engine and heavy-duty drive train, the V923 telehandler offers an increased rated lift capacity of 9,000 pounds for more productivity with every lift cycle and unbeatable pushing strength. A Z-Bar boom linkage delivers greater range of bucket rotation, an increased dump angle at full height and increased breakout force to lift material out of a pile and dump it easily. Operators get increased visibility around the machine with the low-profile boom and wrap-around rear window. Added comfort features, such as the automatic air suspension seat and suspended cab are designed to improve ride quality and keep operators comfortable during a long day's work. Plus, the side-mounted engine, remote oil filters, easily adjustable boom guides, simple cooling system cleanout and double-element air filter make it quick and convenient to service the machine. Use a variety of telehandler attachments on the telescoping boom and get the most challenging jobs off the ground.",

      "Fingertip Controls: Precise attachment control helps to finish the job quickly and efficiently, without having to leave the comfort of the cab - applies to larger brooms with electric-over-hydraulic angle only.",
      "Multidirection Sweeping: Remove debris from curbs, gutters, corners, and obstacles by reversing the direction of the bristles (only available on 64 and 84 in. brooms)",
      "Flush Sweeping: Get as close as you want. Improved sweeping efficiency allows for flush sweeping to a curb or wall on the right side.",
      "High-Torque Motor: With heavier materials and debris, the high-torque motor allows for maximum power for more efficient sweeping.",
      "Storage Stands: Larger brooms include storage stands to provides maximum uptime protection by eliminating bristle distortion when the broom is not in use. On 68-inch and 84-inch angle broom attachments, the stands use a lever to swing the legs up or down. In the down position the legs are closer to the bristles to make attachment to the machine easier.",
      "Patented Spring Design: Provides optimum down-pressure, extended bristle life and excellent cleaning ability (not available on 48-inch).",
      "Bristles: Proven, replaceable, wafer polypropylene bristles provide excellent life and clean ability. Bristles have excellent durability and provide perfect flicking action for superior cleaning.",
      "Sweep a clean path easily and efficiently with the hydraulically-driven angle broom attachment. Quick removal jobs can be completed without damaging pavement surfaces.",
      "The broom bristles have a waved design, delivering more surface clearing ability. This clears a cleaner path and can sweep more snow or debris in one pass. The angle broom attachment is compact, maneuverable and easy to operate, replacing manual labor and hand brooms. Clean small and large areas with less effort and in less time.",
      "Reverse bristle rotation for dustpan sweeping available on the 64 and 84 in. brooms efficiently sweeps leaves, snow, and debris away from corners, curbs, buildings, and obstacles at a lower speed to reduce damage to the cab. Heavy duty bristles have improved wear and better visibility for the operator.",
      "The reversible angle brush is available for all new 400-800 series compact track loaders and skid-steers, as well as Bobcat Toolcats with the 7 Pin Attachment Control Kit.",
      "The angle broom attachment uses a hydraulically-driven, rotating broom that pushes dirt and other debris away from the machine. The angle broom will continuously sweep debris ahead of the machine or angle the broom to windrow material to the side. To easily sweep debris away from obstacles, the broom can reverse direction and pull toward the machine, leaving behind clean corners and angles."

      "Hydraulic 25 Degree Angle: Move debris exactly where you want it using the joystick on your UTV. Finish the job quickly and efficiently without having to leave the comfort of your seat.",
      "Multi-Attachment X-Change (M.A.X.) System: Makes easy work of attaching and detaching the angle broom from the utility vehicle. Fast and easy mounting means spending less time on attachment changes and more time on the job.",
      "Replaceable Bristles: Convoluted polypropylene 24 in. bristles provide excellent life and cleaning ability. Bristles have excellent durability and the spacer-free design provides fast flick action for superior cleaning.",
      "Sweep a clean path easily and efficiently with the Power-Take-Off-driven angle broom attachment. Quick removal jobs can be completed without damaging pavement surfaces year-round. In the winter, it will clear light snowfalls. During the spring and summer, it will dethatch lawns and clean off sidewalks and ball courts. In the fall, use it to sweep leaves and other debris. The worm-gearbox eliminates maintenance like greasing the chain or making tension adjustments. This also makes it easier to replace the bristles by removing only four bolts. The broom bristles have a waved design, delivering more surface-clearing ability. This clears a cleaner path and can sweep more snow or debris in one pass. The angle broom attachment is compact, maneuverable and easy to operate, replacing manual labor. Sweep flush against walls, fences, curbs or other obstructions without drive motor obstructions on the sides of the sweeper. With oscillation and float, you can transition between sidewalks, streets and other surfaces without leaving any snow or debris behind. Clean small and large areas with less effort and in less time. The angle broom is designed with the Multi-Attachment X-Change(tm) (M.A.X.) System system which allows attachments to be changed trouble-free and without tools so you can attach or remove equipment quickly.",
      "The angle broom attachment uses a PTO-driven, rotating broom that sweeps dirt, snow and other debris away from the machine. The angle broom will continuously sweep debris ahead of the UTV or angle the broom to windrow material to the side."

Multiple bit types and teeth enable you to find the right auger to match your digging conditions.The direct drive 15 offers a higher range of speed for drilling holes quicker through softer to moderate soil conditions such as sand, dry material, and light dirt so the hole being dug is cleaned out better. The direct drive 30 and the planetary drive augers offer higher amount of torque for digging into heavier ground surfaces such as rocky, coral or clay. With lower speeds to dig, Planetary augers provide the torque needed to install screw anchors and dig with bits that are over 24 inches in diameter.",

If an auger can't dig those extra inches in the hole, it might mean cutting corners or buying an auger extension. Bobcat augers provide design and geometry that helps do the job right. See how other brands compare.",
      "Torque Challenge",
      "With auger attachments, torque equals power. Greater torque makes it easier to break down rock, power through tree roots or clay, and take on frozen ground. All augers have published torque ratings, but performance on the jobsite matters most. The torque challenge video evaluates the difference.",
      "Direct drive augers are ideal for digging holes for posts, piers, poles, or trees.",
      "Planetary augers deliver the power and force needed to dig in anchor applications and through other extreme ground conditions including rock, shale, clay and frost.",
      "Added Digging Depth: Gain an extra foot of dig depth over competitive units because the entire drive unit follows the bit into the hole. Watch the digging depth challenge to see how other brands compare.",
      "Improved Torque: Bobcat速 auger attachments deliver greater torque when it matters most. All augers have published torque ratings, but performance on the jobsite matters most. The torque challenge video evaluates the difference.",
      "Direct Drive: Provides optimum balance between torque and RPM. Other brands use a planetary auger drive with more moving parts, greater maintenance needs and higher operating costs. Watch the maintenance comparison video to see for yourself.",
      "Combination Hex and Round Output Shaft: A patented Bobcat technology, the combination output shaft allows for both hex and round bits to be utilized, maximizing parts versatility (models 15C and 30C).",
      "Versatile Mounting System: Easy and efficient for attaching the auger to the carrier. Quickly and easily switch to a variety of multiple carriers.",
      "Unique Knuckle Joint Design: allows the auger to dig vertical holes even if your Bobcat unit is on uneven terrain.",
      "Auger Bits and Teeth: A wide variety to match your digging conditions.",
      "Dig holes with speed and plumb-line accuracy using a Bobcat速 auger attachment. Using heavy-duty hydraulics, the auger attachment bites into any soil condition with ease and efficiency. Even in hard and rocky soil, the high torque keeps the auger steady and powerful to maintain performance. Choose between a direct drive auger for an optimum balance between torque and RPM, or a gear-driven planetary auger for applications that require the most torque. Multiple bit types and teeth enable you to find the right auger to match your digging conditions.The direct drive 15 offers a higher range of speed for drilling holes quicker through softer to moderate soil conditions such as sand, dry material, and light dirt so the hole being dug is cleaned out better. The direct drive 30 and the planetary drive augers offer higher amount of torque for digging into heavier ground surfaces such as rocky, coral or clay. With lower speeds to dig, Planetary augers provide the torque needed to install screw anchors and dig with bits that are over 24 inches in diameter.",
      "Direct drive models use a directly mounted hydraulic motor, while planetary models are powered by a gear drive system. The motor turns the output shaft, which is connected to an auger bit to drill into the ground."

      "The auger is a power take-off (PTO) driven implement, so it does not require its own engine or motor. The PTO transfers the power from the compact tractor engine to the auger. You simply attach the post-hole auger to the 3-point hitch and engage the PTO shaft to the tractor. It is important to know if your tractor offers independent PTO or live PTO when engaging your implement. Please read the owner's manual thoroughly.",
      "Choose the Bobcat速 compact tractor post-hole auger implement that is optimized for the appropriate PTO horsepower of your compact tractor. You want the PTO horsepower of the tractor to be higher than required to run the implement."

      "Fingertip Controls: Mounted on the carrier's steering levers, fingertip controls provide quick and easy access to make elevation changes or switch the automatic function on or off, delivering precise and accurate results with maximum operator comfort.",
      "Manual Override Function: While in automatic mode, if the operator pushes a switch to move the blade up or down, automatic mode is momentarily interrupted. When the operator releases the switch the system immediately returns to automatic mode.",
      "Laser Receivers: Deliver a 360-degree operating range. Provide visible indication of where the blade is relative to the ground and an automatic mode indicator.",
      "Increment/Decrement Feature: Move the grade up/down, in 0.1 in. (or 2.5mm) increments up to 2 in. in either direction, making it easier for the operator to make adjustments on-the-fly without leaving the cab to raise or lower the transmitter.",
      "Quick Mounting and Set-up: For ease of use around the jobsite, the laser control system is quickly attached and removed as necessary.",
      "Bobcat速 automatic grading solutions deliver more accurate grading results with less time and less labor. Choose from laser-guided systems and sonic/slope systems. Operators will increase their efficiency and reduce fatigue since they can focus on operating the machine's travel, rather than the blade position. Fewer people are also needed because, with near-perfect accuracy, there is no need for a crew to continually check grade on the jobsite. It's as simple as clicking a button on the loader controls to activate the automatic system.With accuracies better than +/- 1/4 \", automatic grade control systems can also save on expensive finishes such as concrete.",
      "A laser transmitter is used to emit a plane of laser light across the job site. The plane mirrors the completed job site and is used as a reference point to ensure the blade is on-grade at all times. The blade moves up and down automatically to keep the base materials on-grade.Laser transmitters and rod-mounted laser receivers can also quickly determine the amount of material that needs to be added or removed from the site.",
      "For a fully equipped laser grading system, Bobcat offers three laser transmitters: one single slope model and two dual slope models. For flatwork or simple grades, a single slope transmitter delivers excellent results. Both models of dual slope transmitters work well for anything from flatwork to compound set-ups. The laser control system increases precision when operating the box blade or grader attachment. Both the box blade and grader work well on flat and single slopes. On dual slopes, the grader attachment delivers increased functionality, with each side of the blade operating independently.",
      "Grader Attachment: Grade surfaces with precision and control while maximizing productivity with the grader attachment. Designed for use in landscaping, asphalt, curb and concrete flatwork, the grader attachment features blades that move six different ways and a front bolster that oscillates 12 degrees to the right or left, allowing for grading on any surface while minimizing the effect of uneven ground. Box Blade Attachment: Control grading operation with the accuracy and durability of the box blade attachment. The box blade incorporates end wings to help carry spoil and features elevation control, which allows the box blade to travel up and down slopes while still delivering accurate results.",
      "BLR2 Receiver: Machine ControlUsing CANbus communication, the BLR2 laser receiver provides frequent updates (up to 20 times per second) to the control valve on the attachment, delivering high accuracy grading. Indicators and an automatic light on the face of the receiver also provide constant information to the operator. To make grade changes quickly from inside the cab, the \"on grade\" setting of the receiver can be moved up or down - up to 2 in. with certain machine options - for fast, accurate results. The laser receiver can also communicate with instrumentation of the loader.Laser TransmittersFor a fully equipped laser grading system, Bobcat offers three laser transmitters: one single slope model and two dual slope models. Each model includes a hand-held laser receiver. All models feature two-way radio remote control to allow adjustments from across the jobsite or from within the machine. All laser transmitters also offer temperature compensation, ensuring the laser beam stays accurate as temperatures change throughout the day. Accuracy on the jobsite is critical, and a quality laser transmitter provides the high accuracy and the quick adjustment features necessary to get the job done right.",
      "On the jobsite, the laser transmitter is mounted on a tripod to provide a 360-degree plane of reference at a set elevation and slope. Laser receivers, mounted on a mast attached to the box blade or grader attachment, capture the light from the laser transmitter. In manual control mode, the receivers inform the operator via LED lights when the blade needs to move up or down, or to notify that the blade is on grade. In automatic control mode, the receiver informs the blade that it needs to move up or down to stay on grade. With the box blade attachment, one receiver - mounted in the middle - moves the entire blade up or down. With the grader attachment, two receivers are mounted so that so each side of the blade will adjust independently."

      "Install electrical, telephone and television cables",

      "Boring Depth: Bores up to 2 feet deep and up to 30 feet horizontally.",
      "Manual Guide Rod: Starts the bit at the proper angle to ensure accurate drilling. Ideal for working in tight spaces.",
      "Three Positions: Drive head can be mounted in three positions: on the center, right or left side. Allows the attachment to be positioned directly next to obstacles and placed exactly where boring operation is desired.",
      "Versatility: Available with various sizes of bits, reamers and rock heads, allowing for maximum versatility and performance in a variety of environments.",
      "The boring unit attachment saves the time and expense of tearing up sidewalks, driveways and other paved areas. It's an easy way to install underground cables and flexible pipes with little or no damage to existing roads, sidewalks or other existing structures. The hydraulically powered attachment bores horizontally to accommodate pipe or cable up to 4 in. in diameter. After boring, the attachment works to pull the pipe or cable through the hole. The boring unit frame allows the drive head to be mounted, from the front of the loader, in three positions: on the center, right or left side. This allows the attachment to be positioned directly next to obstacles, such as buildings, and be placed exactly where boring operation is desired.",
      "The loader's auxiliary hydraulics power a motor that drives a screw-type boring bit through the ground as the machine is driven forward. The ground is compacted to create a tunnel under the driveway or sidewalk. When the bit reaches the other side, a reaming bit is installed. The loader is backed up and the rotating reaming bit further compacts the soil as it pulls the service through the enlarged tunnel."

      "Clean up spoil piles quickly with the grading tool and reduce manual labor.",
      "Remove the tool when trenching, giving you enhanced visibility into the trench area.",

No tools are required to adjust or remove the work tool.",
      "The Pro Clamp System allows you to:",
      "The standard clamp has a smaller opening compared to the Pro Clamp System, however it has a dual-tooth design which maximizes the clamp capabilities, allowing the attachment to clamp onto many odd-shaped objects and debris. Put the clamp attachment to work with a trenching bucket or three-tine grapple and easily move odd-shaped objects such as tree stumps and broken concrete. The clamp attachment is ideal for moving and removing.",
      "How It Works",
      "Featuring a dual-tooth design, the clamp extends beyond the cutting edge of the bucket for holding objects. When not in use, the clamp retracts fully against the arm of the excavator to prevent interference with possible digging and trenching work.",

      "The Bobcat速 concrete pump simplifies pouring concrete in difficult-to-reach locations. There's no more need for mud buggies, loaders with buckets, wheelbarrows, shovels or chutes. Depending on hose length and diameter, and conditions such as slump, additives and aggregate size and type, this powerful attachment can pump concrete as far as 250 feet horizontally and up to two stories vertically. With a standard hydraulic flow loader, the pump can place concrete up to 18 cubic yards per hour. A high-flow loader can place concrete up to 28 cubic yards per hour.",
      "Attach your Bobcat速 loader to either side of the concrete pump and position the unit where you need it. Then connect the hoses, feed the concrete mix into the hopper and pump."

      "Break and demolish concrete with the drop hammer attachment. To efficiently break up concrete, the drop hammer delivers over 3,600 foot pounds of impact energy combined with a fast cycle time of 20 blows per minute. Upon impact, the drop hammer fractures the material below the surface, leaving the surface free of jagged debris. Between cycles, the drop hammer attachment allows three seconds to reposition and reset the loader. When the attachment is not in use, the hammer stands in the upright position. Compared to standard hydraulic breakers, the drop hammer attachment generates little vibration or noise, meaning less wear on the machine and less noise for the operator and bystanders.",
      "The drop hammer features a chain mechanism with a catch. The catch grabs the weight and raises it up. When the chain rotates over the top, the catch falls and releases the weight, dropping the hammer onto the material to be demolished."

The large-capacity hopper is easy to fill with a skid-steer loader, compact excavator, or by hand. It empties quickly and easily, saving time by reducing trips back and forth to a dumpsite or receiving truck.Applications include landscaping, construction, renovation, demolition tasks and cemeteries. The dumping hopper attachment is also a labor saver for municipalities, golf courses and resort hotels.",

The dumping hopper mounts easily on a Bobcat速 loader and can be transported, detached and parked wherever it is needed to receive or dump materials - even spaces like backyards and buildings. The large-capacity hopper is easy to fill with a skid-steer loader, compact excavator, or by hand. It empties quickly and easily, saving time by reducing trips back and forth to a dumpsite or receiving truck.Applications include landscaping, construction, renovation, demolition tasks and cemeteries. The dumping hopper attachment is also a labor saver for municipalities, golf courses and resort hotels.",
      "Simply park it, load it, and dump it. Once the dumping hopper has been filled, it is re-attached to the loader, transported where contents are needed, and dumped. The Bob-Tach(tm) mounting system allows the dumping hopper to tip forward and empty itself, simply by raising the lift arms and rolling out the Bob-Tach system."

      "The flail cutter attachment clears brush and small trees while distributing cut materials evenly. With a cutting width of 79 in., the flail cutter (or flail mower) delivers excellent cutting, mulching, and mowing action for materials up to 3 in. in diameter. The flotation linkage and compact deck length allow the flail cutter to float over ground contours, maintaining surface contact for optimal mowing performance. The thick steel deck design protects the attachment and provides maximum strength for tough clearing jobs. This efficient attachment excels in applications such as agriculture, landscaping, utility, and rental. Other applications include maintenance around personal and lakefront property, construction sites, power lines, road right-of-ways, trails, and other areas needing brush mowing or small tree removal.",
      "Rather than rotate, the hammers cut vertically so cut materials are thrown down on the ground rather than out to the side. This allows cut materials to be spread evenly for a finer finish. The flail cutter attachment can also be operated while traveling in either forward or reverse."

      "Flotation Tires: Provide excellent flotation to keep the grader moving smoothly over the work area.",
      "Side Shift: Manual side shifts on smaller models move the blade up to 12 in. to the left or right. The hydraulic side shift on larger models provides up to 13 in. to the left or right, making it easier to grade next to buildings, poles, and other obstacles.",
      "Oscillating Bolster: Oscillates to the left or right to minimize the effect of uneven ground.",
      "Proportional Hydraulic Valve: Offers three speeds at which the moldboard is raised or lowered, meaning operation can be more closely matched to the speed of the loader. The longer the operator presses the button that controls the valve, the faster the moldboard moves. Also provides finer control with automatic grading solutions.",
      "Bolt-on Reversible Cutting Edge: When the edge wears out it can be flipped over to provide a fresh cutting edge.",
      "Bolt-on End Wing Kit: Helps to carry more material when fine grading or spreading materials such as sand or gravel. Turns the grader into a box blade, eliminating the need for an additional attachment. Option for larger graders.",
      "Automatic Control Systems: Increase accuracy and productivity. Automatically moves the blade up or down to keep the base material exactly on-grade. Grader is 3D laser-ready. Laser control and sonic/cross slope systems are available.",
      "Grade surfaces with precision and control while maximizing productivity with the grader attachment.",
      "The Bobcat速 grader attachment excels at high-performance grading. Even delicate tasks can be completed with powerful precision. The grader attachment has a blade that moves six or eight different ways to grade any surface. And the bolster oscillates to minimize the effect of uneven ground, delivering consistent grading performance in a variety of environments.",
      "Achieve a consistent grade with ease and turn your Bobcat loader into a high-performance grading machine with the grader attachment.",
      "Hydraulic cylinders independently adjust each side of the moldboard, angle the moldboard and, on larger models, side shift the moldboard. Tires on the bolster provide excellent flotation to keep the grader moving smoothly over the work area.",
      "Smoother operation and quicker reaction of the grader can be gained when paired with the laser control system. With the laser system, the farther the blade is from grade, the more quickly it will move to grade.",
      "A sonic tracer and cross-slope system is available for use with Bobcat's larger grader attachments. Whereas the laser-guided systems require a laser transmitter and can only follow a plane of light, the sonic/slope system will follow the terrain below the sonic tracer (mounted on one side) and maintain a consistent cross-slope that has been predetermined. This system also works well on jobsites in which the transmitter may not have complete visibility to the receivers at all times.",
      "For your most complex design projects, consider the 3D ready system. Using GPS technology or UTS, the system has the ability to accurately and efficiently complete complex designs with accuracy of 3-5 millimeters.",
      "Expand your capabilities and increase your efficiency with the industry's first 3D ready system for compact equipment. Using the plug-and-play system, you'll save time, fuel, and money with millimeter accuracy. Using GPS or UTS, the system has the ability to complete complex design projects including parking lots, sports fields and road work.",
      "Choose between a satellite option for outdoor applications and a universal total station option for indoor applications. After you load a computer-generated model to the loader's control box, the system automatically grades the ground with remarkable accuracy. For you, this means moving dirt to the right spot quicker and getting the job done faster.",
      "With the 3D ready system, you can bring your office and jobsite together. To set it up, simply load a software-generated model file to the CB450 control box. Your loader will take care of the rest. Job progress can be monitored from the office using the Connected Site software. It also gives you the ability to make updates to your designs, wirelessly loading the new model file to your loader on the jobsite in real-time."

And the unique frame design allows the mower to oscillate independently to follow uneven terrain, delivering a close, clean cut. From mowing roadside ditches to large acreages, the mower attachment is ideal for all mowing. The mower is the ideal maintenance attachment for golf courses, landscape contractors, nurseries, hobby farms, municipalities, and large-lot rural homeowners.",

      "Mulching and Side-Discharge Kits: Available to easily convert the mower to fit the application.",
      "Anti-Scalping Wheel: Protects the mower blades from damage by touching the ground first when mowing over uneven terrain. Also, prevents the mower deck from scraping the ground, resulting in longer blade life and consistent cutting height.",
      "Castor Wheels: Combined with the attachment frame, the castor wheels allow the mower to oscillate independently of the loader, providing a floating deck to better follow uneven terrain. Also, can be adjusted for different cutting heights, ranging from 2 to 5.5 in.",
      "Cutting Blades: Designed for mowing efficiency, the mower attachment features three overlapping cutting blades that eliminate skips for even cutting action.",
      "Deck Bracing: Located on the top of the mower to allow for a smooth bottom, delivering improved air and material flow.",
      "Belt-Driven: For increased uptime protection, the hydraulic motor powers a single V-belt, eliminating shear pins and related downtime.",
      "Front Mount: Mower attachment mounts to the front of the carrier for maximum working area visibility.",
      "Safety Shut-Off: Incorporated into the attachment frame. If the mower exceeds 8.5 in. of vertical travel, the safety shut-off turns blade rotation off.",
      "Blade Mounting: Dual mounting bolts make blade replacement easy.",
      "Mow the roughest terrain into a clean-cut landscape with the mower attachment. The front-mounted unit cuts grass before it's driven over, allowing excellent working visibility of the area to be mowed. Powered by a direct-drive hydraulic motor, three overlapping blades eliminate skips for clean cutting action, discharging cut materials to the rear. And the unique frame design allows the mower to oscillate independently to follow uneven terrain, delivering a close, clean cut. From mowing roadside ditches to large acreages, the mower attachment is ideal for all mowing. The mower is the ideal maintenance attachment for golf courses, landscape contractors, nurseries, hobby farms, municipalities, and large-lot rural homeowners.",
      "The mower attachment is front-mounted to the carrier for maximum working visibility. Cut materials are discharged under the carrier and to the rear, away from buildings, trees and fences. To control cutting height, the castor wheels can be raised or lowered ranging from 2 to 5.5 in., in adjustable half-in. increments."

The compact design of the packer wheel allows it to operate in small areas, increasing the versatility of the carrier. No auxiliary hydraulics are required to operate.",
      "The wheel rolls through the trench using the carrier controls. The weight of the wheel and down pressure from the carrier provides the compacting force. While in the trench, the open rim sheep foot design of the wheel penetrates through the lift of backfill to compact the fill from the bottom up rather than from the top down. This eliminates bridging and voids for better compaction. The depth of the lift can be varied to match moisture content, texture and other soil conditions."

When attached to a Bobcat速 loader, the rear stabilizer attachment increases the digging capability by transferring the weight of the loader to the attachment, giving the attachment more force to power through the dig. Street pads protect sensitive surfaces from damage and grouser bars help keep the loader from being pulled toward the work area. The rear stabilizer attachment also helps by leveling the loader on uneven terrain, keeping the machine stabilized in any conditions. Increase digging performance while maintaining stability with the rear stabilizer attachment."

Unlike broadcast seeders, the seeder attachment is a ground-driven unit that seeds directly into the soil for better germination and more accurate coverage. Front rollers firm and press small rocks below the surface while also pressing seed into the seedbed. Rear rollers split the shallow ridges and gently form the soil around the seed, ensuring optimum seed-to-soil contact. This action eliminates broadcasting seed into unwanted areas such as flowerbeds and walkways. At a production rate of more than 2 acres per hour, the seeder attachment gets the job done quickly and efficiently. Can be front mounted on a loader or Toolcat(tm) machine, or rear mounted on a 3-pt. hitch.",

Damage to snow blade components is prevented if the snow blade contacts sections of raised concrete on sidewalks or other obstructions. Standard snow blades feature a trip moldboard and heavy duty snow blades feature a trip edge.High visibility masts at each end of the moldboard to help keep operators aware of the blade corners. Additionally, since most snow is cleared at night or in the early morning, when it is dark. The heavy duty snow blades also offer 5 degrees of oscillation to either side that help keep the cutting edge moving snow around drainage in parking lots and transitions from sidewalks to streets. Optional features include rubber or polyurethane cutting edges and end-wing kits. The end-wing kits make the attachment more versatile by allowing the snow blade to also be used as a snow pusher."

      "Abrasion-Resistant Skid Shoes: Deliver powerful snow pushing results. Also, abrasion-resistant feature provides maximum uptime protection.",
      "Blade Flotation and Oscillation: Free-floating blade movement offers lift, tilt and oscillation to keep the moldboard in contact with the surface across the width of the blade. Protects against surface damage while cleanly removing snow from uneven surfaces. Also, blade flotation extends skid shoe life by limiting excessive down-pressure when removing snow from irregular surfaces.",
      "Cutting Edge Support: Rear support on the cutting edge provides additional strength to the moldboard.",
      "End Wings: Keep snow within the width of the attachment and prevent snow from spilling over the sides, eliminating additional cleanup on the jobsite.",
      "Exterior Gusseting: Reduces snow build-up inside the boxed blade, allowing for more snow collecting and pushing power with fewer stops.",
      "Rubber Cutting Edge: For optimum surface protection, rubber cutting edges deliver pushing power while protecting sensitive surfaces. Polyurethane cutting edges also available.",
      "Bob-Tach(tm) Attachment Mounting System: Turns any carrier into a multi-job machine with a tight-fit attachment hook-up. Fast and easy attachment changes mean spending less time attaching and more time on the job.",
      "Tri-formed box for strength: The moldboard has a plow structure like no other in its class. The full length tri-formed box structure gives it the most torque resistance and rigidity. Designs like this have been used in the highway plows for years. The moldboard sheet itself is 10ga grade 50 steel which has a higher tensile strength, making it harder to dent and tear, prolonging the life of the finish and plow itself.",
      "Heavy duty powder coating: Powder coat and primer baked at 400+ degrees safeguards all of the steel components and keeps the blade looking great for years. A method of applying seam sealer to all un-welded joints prior to the finish getting baked on eliminates rust marks and substantially increases the life and appearance of the entire finish.",
      "9\" plow blade trip edge: The Blade features a tall, 9'' safety trip-edge which prevents accidental damage when encountering hidden obstacles by tripping back 68 degrees. Powered by four compression style return springs and pivoting on 7 total 1 inch trip pins, it trips when you need it, and stays put when you don't.",
      "Effective plow angle: The attack angle is at 65 degrees so that it scrapes cleanly - forward and backwards. Mounted onto the trip edge is a high carbon steel cutting edge, 6 inches tall, 5/8 inches thick. Angle plowing with a skid steer at low speed is efficient, and it's made even better with the 35 degree max angle that the plow can achieve. This is often more productive and efficient than plowing with trucks.",
      "Replaceable plow cutting edge: Our cutting edges meet highway department standards, and will fit up with any 'standard highway punch' design, available almost anywhere. No one can afford downtime during a storm, so just replace the edge as needed - no need to move, rotate, flip or flop",
      "Protective sleeves and advanced couplers on the hydraulic system: Protective sleeves are added to all of the hoses. Next we include an advanced male and female coupling that will connect by hand with residual pressure of 300 bar or 2900 psi locked in the hydraulic circuit which will connect with residual pressure without releasing any fluid into the environment. This robust system complements the rugged features and operation of this system in any environment the most extreme winter can produce.",
      "Blade oscillation: Prevents situations when your blade doesn't stay flat on the plowing surface, whether due to uneven pavement or improper boom adjustment. The blade stays flat on the plowing surface from tip to tip whether fully angled or straight, even with down pressure applied.",
      "Transform simple blade into box plow: So simple, yet so genius. The simple design of the box gives it a durable structure that overcomes the destructive tendencies so many snow removal operations can produce.",
      "Flexible polyurethane skids: Polyurethane skids are flexible, rather than rigid steel shoes, reducing any bending or denting. They also feature 4 slots in the rear that allow the skid to self-adjust upwards as the cutting edge of the plow becomes worn. This ensures that the plow is always scraping and cleaning like it should.",
      "Low maintenance: Every detail of the box flows right into the overall theme of low maintenance and simplicity. The polyurethane bumpers protect the finish, while the pre-punched 10 inch wide snow catches prevent spillage while pushing.",
      "Replaceable side panels: Easy to bolt on in case of replacement and come standard.",
      "Collect and push snow - and clear big-time winter jobs - with the snow pusher attachment.The open bottom and wide body deliver pure pushing power, for maximum snow removal speed and efficiency. And with more collecting and holding capabilities, larger areas can be cleaned without stopping as often. Flotation and oscillation of the moldboard keep the snow pusher in contact with the ground without damaging equipment or property, allowing for snow removal over decorative and sensitive surfaces.When operating on terrain that isn't perfectly flat, allow the blade to float for following ground contours and collecting more snow. When powering through snow on flat surfaces, keep blade position fixed for clearing hard-packed snow and ice.",
      "When a heavy snow is slowing you down, the BobcatR Snow Pusher Pro will help you make light work of a tough job. Built for the efficiency of a commercial snow remover, this attachment has both an angle snow blade and a snow pusher all in one for maximum effectiveness. 3 different sizes are compatible with most Bobcat Compact Track Loaders and Skid-Steer Loaders. Available in 96in., 108in., and 120in.

      "Tough Soils: For ripping though the toughest hardpan and richest clay soils, harness the additional horsepower of high-flow hydraulics, which provide tremendous torque to the drum. Increased drum torque creates a true powered box blade, delivering a smooth jobsite with fewer passes. Available on 72 and 84-in. models.",

      "Removable End Plates: Used to achieve a box blade effect. When removable end plates are attached, soil in front of the drum is carried along and can be used to fill in low spots for an even finish. Without, material is pushed to the side and can later be picked up with a bucket.",
      "Rubber Flap: Keeps large material from going over the drum and allows finer material through.",

To level and grade a surface, lock the drum for a box blade effect. Or place the drum in the float position to prepare the soil while following the contours of the terrain. The soil conditioner is a versatile, cost-effective attachment no landscaping crew should be without. Pulverize the soil while leveling and filling in fewer passes with the soil conditioner attachment.",
      "Carbide-tipped teeth on the drum easily rip through hardpan and pulverize clumps. Clumps are ground up, and rocks and other debris are windrowed to the edge of the jobsite. A rubber flap above the drum keeps larger material from going over the drum while allowing fine materials through for a smooth finish. The drum rotates in either direction to allow working in forward or reverse.Box blade end wings are standard to help move large amounts of material and fill in low spots. Remove the end wings to allow for even distribution of material.An oscillating booster is standard on larger models. Oscillation keeps the drum parallel to the ground and helps minimize the effect of bumps and potholes, resulting in a smoother finish in fewer passes. The oscillating bolster combined with hydraulic depth and angle controls also make it easy to cut swales for drainage and to sculpt the land.On larger models, another standard feature is the ability to lock the drum or allow it to float. In the locked position, the soil conditioner acts much like a box blade and will level the surface. In the float position, the drum is able to float over the terrain, preparing the soil without leveling sculpted land."

      "Remove stumps in large, open areas and small, compact environments",
      "Access smaller spaces such as backyards and gate openings",
      "90-Degree Angle Mount: With a front mount attachment system, the stump grinder is mounted at a 90-degree angle to the operator for increased visibility to the cutting area.",
      "Auxiliary Hydraulics Operation: Stump grinder operates off the carrier's auxiliary hydraulics, eliminating an engine to maintain while operating.",
      "Carbide-Tipped Teeth: Efficiently rip through hard wood, providing long life and uptime protection for the attachment.",
      "Front Mount System: Easier to maneuver into tight areas and to position stump grinder over the stump, delivering accurate grinding action and operation.",
      "Unique Valve Design: Minimizes the cutting wheel from stalling while in the cut.",
      "Rubber Deflecting Shields: Provide additional operator comfort and protection from wood chips.",
      "Grind tree stumps into mulch with the powerful action of the stump grinder attachment. Designed for maximum operating capability, the stump grinder mounts directly to the front of a carrier for easy maneuvering in tight areas and positioning exactly where grinding action is needed. Mounted at a 90-degree angle to the operator, the stump grinder offers increased visibility to the cutting area, giving the operator the same wide view as with any pull-behind grinder. The stump grinder is the ideal attachment for landscaping contractors, homeowners with acreage, campus facilities, municipalities, and rental contractors.Stumps are eliminated even more quickly when used with machines equipped with high flow hydraulics."

      "Built for easy and efficient soil preparation, the 3-point tiller implement quickly turns a backyard plot into a soil bed for gardening. It's perfect for cultivating, aerating and stirring up soil for gardens, food plots and other tillage needs. This compact tractor implement can be switched between forward or reverse rotation, allowing top-cutting and under-cutting in either direction. Adjustable runners allow you to till soil up to 7 inches deep, and each flange includes six tines for more efficient digging with less vibration. Oil-bath lubrication with an all-gear-driven driveline delivers better performance and less maintenance. Designed to work closer to buildings, fences and trees.",

      "The tine rake implement easily collects debris and smooths lawns in preparation for reseeding and fertilizing. Or put it to work maintaining gravel parking lots, driveways or walking trails on your property. This compact tractor implement is ideal for smoothing, raking or contouring soil surfaces in preparation for planting or seeding. You can quickly get rid of unwanted surface debris, including rocks, roots, hay, weeds, leaves and small tree limbs. Angle the 3-point rake to pull debris off to the side, straighten it to pull debris into a pile or reverse it to push debris piles out of the way.",

      "Smooths soil.",
      "Maintains gravel driveways or walking paths.",
      "Rotates/Reverses: 3-point rake rotates a full 360 degrees with five forward and five reverse settings to be pulled or pushed.",
      "Three Widths: Available in 60-inch, 72-inch and 84-inch tractor tine widths.",
      "Replaceable Tines: High-carbon curved tines withstand wear and tear and can be replaced to increase the life of the implement.",
      "Category 1 3-Point Hitch: A 3-point hitch is used to attach your rear-mounted tine rake implement. An adjustable top link is centered above two lower link arms, comprising the three points. The tine rake implement quickly and easily attaches with connecting pins at each point.",
      "Durable, Corrosion-Resistant Powder-Coat Finish: Protects the rake for extra-long life out in the elements.",
      "The tine rake implement does not require power take-off (PTO). Simply attach it to the 3-point hitch and get started. It rotates a full 360 degrees with five forward and five reverse settings to be pulled or pushed, making it easy to collect and move material. Can be angled or reversed simply by relocating the index pin.",

The large, wheel-type compactor compresses soil down in the trench, using a vibratory shaker box for optimum compaction in any soil type. To ensure proper RPM, the vibratory shaker box features a built-in flow regulator. The trench compactor attachment works most efficiently in trenches four to 12 in. wide, and up to four feet deep. Power into the soil and pack it down with force. For trenches that are more than two feet deep, backfill and compact the soil in two or three layers to achieve desired compaction. This attachment is ideal for locations such as backyards, golf courses, and parks. It finishes off any trenching job, working to power down and compress the soil for a neatly-packed trench."

Designed for mini track loaders, the vibratory plow attachment is the ideal tool for installing pipe and cable with minimal ground disturbance. Dig down with the adjustable plow blade, available in either pull or chute configurations. To preserve surrounding sod conditions, a coulter wheel cuts sod immediately ahead of the plow blade while the pressure foot holds the sod down as the blade moves up and down. The result is a knife-like slit that almost disappears as the cut is driven over by the machine. The vibratory plow is the ideal attachment for landscaping and utility contractors looking to expand jobsite versatility of their mini track loader machines.",
      "For pulling pipe through the ground, a threaded pipe puller is available for working with either blade on the vibratory plow. Cable grips are also available-in up to three sizes-for attaching to the blade and pulling the wire through the ground. For laying wire into the ground, an optional wire reel carrier can be mounted on the plow to feed wire through the chute blade and directly into the ground."
