Adding to that success formula, the Hyundai HX series features eco-friendly, high-performance engines that meet Tier 4 Final emission requirements. At Hyundai, reliable productivity is more than just a promise. The robust upper and lower frame structure can endure external shock and heavy workloads for many thousands of hours. HX series is designed with the operator in mind. A key feature of the new operator's cab in each HX series excavator is the convenient clustering of electronic controls and monitoring functions, resulting in improved operator accuracy and efficiency.",
