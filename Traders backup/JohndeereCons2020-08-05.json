      "How variable-speed drive works:",
      "The Gator™ HPX is equipped with many standard features that provide for comfortable and convenient operation:",
      "The Gator™ HPX is equipped with heavy-duty, coil-over shock, semi-independent rear suspension with 89 mm (3.5 in.) of suspension travel. This provides a comfortable ride with the cargo box unloaded while also minimizing suspension sag when the cargo box is loaded.",
      "The Gator HPX is equipped with a MacPherson strut, independent front suspension, providing a comfortable ride and excellent work capability. The heavy-duty, ductile cast-iron, single A-arm provides 131 mm (5.15 in.) of suspension travel for excellent handling and ride quality.",
      "The Gator™ HPX is configured from the factory with OPS and standard occupant side retention (OSR) nets or deluxe cab frame.",
      "Nets are standard equipment on the Gator HPX. Features of the nets include:",
      "The deluxe cargo box consists of a 15 percent glass-filled polypropylene composite material that eliminates rust and dents and reduces noise.",
      "The tailgate can be opened or removed for easier cleanout and to carry longer items. The tailgate has been improved, features truck-like performance, and can be operated with one hand.",
      "The standard-installed lanyards can also be removed to lower the tailgate 150 degrees for convenient loading and unloading tasks.",
      "The deluxe cargo box is easier to latch, unlatch, raise, and lower with the integrated handle design and gas assist. A prop rod is provided to hold the box in the upright position for operator convenience, as well as limit box pivot travel.",
      "The deluxe cargo box offers integrated tie-down points for increased versatility. Tie-down points are located in the following areas:",

      "As the engine speed increases, the spring-loaded drive clutch is closed by weights being forced out by centrifugal force.",
      "As the drive clutch closes, the belt rides up to the largest diameter of the drive clutch and forces open the driven clutch.",
      "With the belt running in the smallest diameter of the driven clutch, the speed being transferred to the transaxle is increased.",
      "The driven clutch is designed to sense varying loads (inclines, mud, etc.) and constantly adjusts drive speed upward or downward so that engine rpm remains constant at constant throttle position.",
      "Two-speed, fully-enclosed, oil bath transaxle allows superior pulling ability Low range is 0 km/h to 19 km/h (0 mph to 12 mph) High range is 0 km/h to 40 km/h (0 mph to 25 mph)",

      "Powerful diesel engine system",
      "The Gator™ HPX Utility Vehicle has a precision-engineered drivetrain system to better utilize engine power and to improve acceleration, hauling, towing, and hill-climbing capabilities. Power is transmitted from the engine through a continuously-variable clutch system to the transaxle.",
      "Key elements of the drive system include:",
      "The variable-speed drive consists of two clutches and a drive belt:",
      "How variable-speed drive works:",
      "The Gator™ HPX is equipped with many standard features that provide for comfortable and convenient operation:",
      "The Gator™ HPX is equipped with heavy-duty, coil-over shock, semi-independent rear suspension with 89 mm (3.5 in.) of suspension travel. This provides a comfortable ride with the cargo box unloaded while also minimizing suspension sag when the cargo box is loaded.",
      "The Gator HPX is equipped with a MacPherson strut, independent front suspension, providing a comfortable ride and excellent work capability. The heavy-duty, ductile cast-iron, single A-arm provides 131 mm (5.15 in.) of suspension travel for excellent handling and ride quality.",
      "The Gator™ HPX is configured from the factory with OPS and standard occupant side retention (OSR) nets or deluxe cab frame.",
      "Nets are standard equipment on the Gator HPX. Features of the nets include:",
      "The deluxe cargo box consists of a 15 percent glass-filled polypropylene composite material that eliminates rust and dents and reduces noise.",
      "The tailgate can be opened or removed for easier cleanout and to carry longer items. The tailgate has been improved, features truck-like performance, and can be operated with one hand.",
      "The standard-installed lanyards can also be removed to lower the tailgate 150 degrees for convenient loading and unloading tasks.",
      "The deluxe cargo box is easier to latch, unlatch, raise, and lower with the integrated handle design and gas assist. A prop rod is provided to hold the box in the upright position for operator convenience, as well as limit box pivot travel.",
      "The deluxe cargo box offers integrated tie-down points for increased versatility. Tie-down points are located in the following areas:",
      "The deluxe cargo box easily converts to a flat bed. The flatbed configuration allows operators to load larger cargo",
      "CAUTION: Carrying extra-long cargo that extends beyond the box can adversely affect stability.",

      "Variable-speed drive",
      "Drive clutch is attached to and rotated by the engine.",
      "Driven clutch is attached to and drives the transaxle.",
      "As the engine speed increases, the spring-loaded drive clutch is closed by weights being forced out by centrifugal force.",
      "As the drive clutch closes, the belt rides up to the largest diameter of the drive clutch and forces open the driven clutch.",
      "With the belt running in the smallest diameter of the driven clutch, the speed being transferred to the transaxle is increased.",
      "The driven clutch is designed to sense varying loads (inclines, mud, etc.) and constantly adjusts drive speed upward or downward so that engine rpm remains constant at constant throttle position.",
      "Two-speed, fully-enclosed, oil bath transaxle allows superior pulling ability Low range is 0 km/h to 19 km/h (0 mph to 12 mph) High range is 0 km/h to 40 km/h (0 mph to 25 mph)",

      "Through the use of a separately excited controller, the Gator TE offers the following unique features:",
      "Power is transferred through a transaxle with helical gearing for low gear noise.",
      "The Gator™ TE is equipped with an Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) approved onboard charger. Located under the passenger seat, the onboard charger allows the user to charge their TE from any location containing a wall receptacle. This saves the user time, as they do not have to travel back to the maintenance area for charging; charging can be done anywhere. The onboard charger is designed with a wide input voltage range from 85 - 265 VAC, making it capable for worldwide application. Power factor correction and 12A maximum current draw ensures the charger will work reliably from any power outlet in the world, even through surges and sags.Improved run time",
      "The onboard charger features advanced temperature sensor technology that improves the information flow coming in and out of charger. The batteries are allowed to charge more fully than they were ever able to before; this can improve run time by up to 75 percent (depending on use cycle).",
      "Important safety features of the charger are as follows:",
      "The Gator TE is equipped with an external AC input IEC connector on the driver side of the vehicle to allow the flexibility of where the charger cord is stored. There is a multicolor LED indicator for low charge, more than 80 percent charge, full charge, or fault.",
      "The heavy-duty design with arc-welded uni-body construction provides strength and manufacturing tolerance control.",
      "Many of the Gator™ TE's standard features offer the operator and passenger a smooth, comfortable ride.",
      "The Gator TE's controls and improved walk-through platform provide easy entry/exit for both operator and passenger.",
      "The deluxe cargo box consists of a 15 percent glass-filled polypropylene composite material that eliminates rust and dents and reduces noise.",
      "The tailgate can be opened or removed for easier cleanout and to carry longer items. The tailgate has been improved, features truck-like performance, and can be operated with one hand.",
      "The standard installed lanyards can also be removed to lower the tailgate to 150 degrees for convenient loading and unloading tasks.",
      "A prop rod (B) is provided to hold the box in the upright position for operator convenience, as well as limit box pivot travel.",
      "The deluxe cargo box offers integrated tie-down points for increased versatility. Tie-down points are located in the following areas:",
      "The deluxe cargo box easily converts to a flat bed. The flatbed configuration allows loading larger cargo.NOTE: Cargo box shown on Gator TX. Gator TE rear axle configuration is different.",

      "The variable-speed drive consists of two clutches connected by a drive belt:",
      "Features include:",
      "How the variable-speed drive works:",
      "Transaxle",
      "The transaxle is fully enclosed and runs in oil for reliability.",
      "Helical gears are used for quiet operation.",
      "Differential design reduces scuffing of the turf during turns because the inside wheels turn slower than the outside wheels (vehicles that have a solid axle shaft must skid the inside wheel when making a turn).",
      "Traction assist (differential lock) is built into the transaxle:",

      "Numerous features offer the operator and passenger a comfortable ride and provide many operating conveniences.",
      "The control location and walk-through platform provide easy entry/exit for the operator and passenger.",
      "The strong, 16-gauge cargo box allows hauling heavy and bulky cargo.",
      "The load of the box is placed directly over the rear wheels, where the load is in the most stable position. The 63.5-com (25-in.) load height for the Gator TS allows easy loading and unloading of material.",
      "The cargo box can be manually tilted up to allow access to the drive system or to assist in cleaning out the box.",
      "Box dump angles (degrees)",
      "The tailgate can be opened or removed for easier cleanout and to carry longer items.",
      "The box design includes tie-downs on load guard and box sides.CAUTION: Carrying extra-long cargo that extends beyond the box can adversely affect stability.",

      "No shifting necessary as operator increases speed",
      "Adjusts speed to the load to avoid bogging down when going up a hill or through challenging conditions because the wrong gear was selected",
      "As the engine speed increases, the spring-loaded drive clutch is closed by weights being forced out by centrifugal force.",
      "As the drive clutch closes, the belt rides up to the largest diameter of the drive clutch and forces open the driven clutch.",
      "With the belt running in the smallest diameter of the driven clutch, the speed being transferred to the transaxle is increased.",
      "The driven clutch is designed to sense varying loads (inclines, mud, etc.) and constantly adjusts the drive speed upward or downward, so the engine rpm remains constant at constant throttle position.",

      "The Gator™ XUV590E and XUV590M Crossover Series Utility Vehicle is powered by a 586-cc (35.8-cu in.), inline twin-cylinder, electronic fuel-injected (EFI) gasoline engine. The engine is electronically controlled through an engine control unit (ECU) to ensure optimal engine performance.",
      "The engine offers the following performance and reliability features:",
      "* The engine horsepower information is provided by the engine manufacturer to be used for comparison purposes only. The actual operating horsepower will be less.",
      "The cargo box consists of a high-density polyethylene copolymer composite material that eliminates rust, dents, and reduces noise. This large, one-piece design has rounded inside corners to ensure material removal when tilted. The composite box is highly ribbed and supported with a welded, steel-ladder structure to ensure hard-driving performance and longevity. The three highly-styled exterior pieces are made of TPO for extra durability.",
      "The tailgate can be opened or removed for easier cleanout and to carry longer items. It features truck-like performance and can be operated with one hand.",

      "The tire scrubbing, which also creates unwanted heat and wear in the tire, can be eliminated by turning the inside wheel at a greater angle than the outside one (Ackerman steering).",
      "NOTE: Some competitors use parallel steering instead of Ackerman steering.",
      "Bump steering defines the change in the forward steering angle (thus wheel position) as the suspension travels through its full motion. A large amount of angular change (5 degrees to 7 degrees) will alter the vehicle's direction and excessively move the steering wheel.",
      "Having the utility vehicles come pre-wired for a winch from the factory greatly reduces the winch install time. Two of the RSX860M chassis come from the factory prewired for a winch: all power steering models and the winch-ready chassis.",
      "Components included in the winch-ready chassis factory installed:",

This large, one-piece design has rounded inside corners to ensure material removal when tilted. The composite box is highly ribbed and supported with a welded steel-ladder structure to ensure hard-driving performance and longevity. The three highly styled exterior pieces are made of thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) for extra durability.",
      "The tailgate can be opened or removed for easier cleanout and to carry longer items. It features truck-like performance and can be operated with one hand. The tailgate's pivot point is made of hardened steel for durability and designed for tool-less removal. The standard lanyards can also be disconnected without tools to remove the tailgate for convenient loading and unloading tasks.",
      "The cargo box ease of use is critical to performing tasks quickly and efficiently. Starting with the truck-style tailgate, the removal of content in this cargo box is much easier. The manual release functions as the lift lever as well, done in a smooth, one step motion. It can even be tilted from both sides of the vehicle. To reduce the overall effort of lift, the pivot point of the cargo box is closer to the center. The combination of easy-to-use attributes makes this cargo box best in class.",
      "With the removal of two bolts, the cargo box can easily be detached from the vehicle frame for ease of servicing.",
      "The cargo box offers integrated tie-down points for increased versatility. Tie-down points are located in the following areas:",

The model year 2018 Gator ™ RSX860 joins the rest of the current utility vehicle lineup with a 12-month or 1000-hour warranty. This gives assurance the RSX860 will be ready when it is needed the most.",
      "Electronic power-steering assist system (EPAS). Features of EPAS include: Anti-kickback feature reduces the amount of steering unwinding when traversing difficult terrain. The system is speed sensing and adjusts steering effort as the speed of the vehicle changes. As speed increases there is less steering assist for improved road feel. As speed decreases steering assist increases to give lower steering efforts for improved maneuverability. A warning/functional light on the instrument panel provides self-diagnostics and a warning light in the situation of no assist. Torque sensor measures steering wheel input so the on-board computer can provide the appropriate output for various driving situations.",

The engine control unit (ECU) and exhaust temperature management (ETM) system work together to continuously regenerate the exhaust filter using a natural cleaning process sometimes referred to as passive regeneration.",
      "If natural filter cleaning cannot be achieved based on temperature, load, and speed, then particulate matter (PM) must be removed using an automatic cleaning process sometimes referred to as active regeneration. In most cases, filter cleaning does not impact machine operation or require operator involvement. Higher pressures created by our Final Tier 4 (FT4)/Stage IV high-pressure fuel system extend intervals between automatic cleanings.",
      "How EGR worksEGR reduces the high temperatures where nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds are formed in the engine cylinders by replacing excess oxygen with a prescribed amount of cooled exhaust gas.",
      "Exhaust gases contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. The EGR valve, in conjunction with the venturi and ECU, allows a controlled amount of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold to mix with the incoming fresh air. Replacing excess oxygen with cooled exhaust gas leads to lower combustion temperatures, creating less NOx. In addition, EGR allows for advanced timing, leading to optimal performance of the engine, maximizing fuel economy.",
      "Flow of exhaust during engine operationExhaust airflow enters into the EGR cooler from the exhaust manifold near the turbocharger.",
      "Based on engine load, air temperatures, and rpm, the ECU opens or closes the EGR valve, allowing a measured percentage of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold.",
      "The gases mix with the rest of the incoming air from the turbocharger and aftercooler before entering the cylinders.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper. A secondary lowering function accumulator is included with the hydraulic valves so the scraper can be lowered if hydraulic power is lost.",

      "The John Deere exhaust filter is integrated into the engine design and electronics to provide a seamless operator experience. The engine control unit (ECU) and exhaust temperature management (ETM) system work together to continuously regenerate the exhaust filter using a natural cleaning process sometimes referred to as passive regeneration.",
      "If natural filter cleaning cannot be achieved based on temperature, load, and speed, then particulate matter (PM) must be removed using an automatic cleaning process sometimes referred to as active regeneration. In most cases, filter cleaning does not impact machine operation or require operator involvement. Higher pressures created by our Final Tier 4 (FT4)/Stage IV high-pressure fuel system extend intervals between automatic cleanings.",
      "How EGR worksEGR reduces the high temperatures where nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds are formed in the engine cylinders by replacing excess oxygen with a prescribed amount of cooled exhaust gas.",
      "Exhaust gases contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. The EGR valve, in conjunction with the venturi and ECU, allows a controlled amount of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold to mix with the incoming fresh air. Replacing excess oxygen with cooled exhaust gas leads to lower combustion temperatures, creating less NOx. In addition, EGR allows for advanced timing, leading to optimal performance of the engine, maximizing fuel economy.",
      "Flow of exhaust during engine operationExhaust airflow enters into the EGR cooler from the exhaust manifold near the turbocharger.",
      "Based on engine load, air temperatures, and rpm, the ECU opens or closes the EGR valve, allowing a measured percentage of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold.",
      "The gases mix with the rest of the incoming air from the turbocharger and aftercooler before entering the cylinders.",
      "The following diagrams illustrate how air flows through the engine (PSS).",
      "For added performance and efficiency, the engine passes the exhaust gases through an EGR cooler before it enters the engine.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper. A secondary lowering function accumulator is included with the hydraulic valves so the scraper can be lowered if hydraulic power is lost.",

      "The John Deere exhaust filter is integrated into the engine design and electronics to provide a seamless operator experience. The engine control unit (ECU) and exhaust temperature management (ETM) system work together to continuously regenerate the exhaust filter using a natural cleaning process sometimes referred to as passive regeneration.",
      "If natural filter cleaning cannot be achieved based on temperature, load, and speed, then particulate matter (PM) must be removed using an automatic cleaning process sometimes referred to as active regeneration. In most cases, filter cleaning does not impact machine operation or require operator involvement. Higher pressures created by our Final Tier 4 (FT4)/Stage IV high-pressure fuel system extend intervals between automatic cleanings.",
      "How EGR worksEGR reduces the high temperatures where nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds are formed in the engine cylinders by replacing excess oxygen with a prescribed amount of cooled exhaust gas.",
      "Exhaust gases contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. The EGR valve, in conjunction with the venturi and ECU, allows a controlled amount of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold to mix with the incoming fresh air. Replacing excess oxygen with cooled exhaust gas leads to lower combustion temperatures, creating less NOx. In addition, EGR allows for advanced timing, leading to optimal performance of the engine, maximizing fuel economy.",
      "Flow of exhaust during engine operationExhaust airflow enters into the EGR cooler from the exhaust manifold near the turbocharger.",
      "Based on engine load, air temperatures, and rpm, the ECU opens or closes the EGR valve, allowing a measured percentage of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold.",
      "The gases mix with the rest of the incoming air from the turbocharger and aftercooler before entering the cylinders.",
      "The following diagrams illustrate how air flows through the engine (PSS).",
      "For added performance and efficiency, the engine passes the exhaust gases through an EGR cooler before it enters the engine.",

The control layout of the CommandARM utilizes a clean and efficient design which groups controls by function and builds upon John Deere's history of intuitive and ergonomic control placement and operation. The design of the CommandARM allows for a 40-degree right seat swivel and adjustable positioning matching the operator's preference.",

      "ThrottleThe throttle design incorporates buttons which control FieldCruise speed, and transmission eco settings.",
      "Tractor function controlsLocated just to the right of the throttle is the Auto-Trac activation button and four sequence controls for iTEC functions. Behind the iTEC sequence controls there are buttons which control the activation and deactivation of differential lock. Differential lock can also be activated by the foot switch on the cab floor.",
      "Controls for radio, lights, rotary beacon (if equipped), hazard flashers, and HVAC system are located to the center-right on the CommandARM, along with power take-off (PTO) for rear PTO.",
      "Seat swivelThe design of the CommandARM allows for up to 40 degrees of right-hand seat swivel.",
      "The Generation 4 CommandCenters features fast adjustment of tractor functions and controls and are integrated into the CommandARM to create a seamless control center.",
      "The following functions can be adjusted and accessed using the CommandCenter display:",
      "The Generation 4 CommandCenter systems have the capability of Remote Display Access (RDA). RDA allows improved communication between an offsite farm manager or dealer and the equipment operator. The user can view exactly what the operator sees on the GreenStar™ 3 2630 Display and Generation 4 CommandCenter from almost any internet-connected device. RDA is available on the 4600 and 4100 CommandCenter and allows for an increase in productivity with quicker problem resolution. By using RDA, the cost of operation will decrease due to reduced labor and travel costs, and maximum efficiency will increase profit.",
      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper. A secondary lowering function accumulator is included with the hydraulic valves so the scraper can be lowered if hydraulic power is lost.",

      "If natural filter cleaning cannot be achieved based on temperature, load, and speed, then particulate matter (PM) must be removed using an automatic cleaning process sometimes referred to as active regeneration. In most cases, filter cleaning does not impact machine operation or require operator involvement. Higher pressures created by our Final Tier 4 (FT4)/Stage IV high-pressure fuel system extend intervals between automatic cleanings.",
      "How EGR worksEGR reduces the high temperatures where nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds are formed in the engine cylinders by replacing excess oxygen with a prescribed amount of cooled exhaust gas.",
      "Exhaust gases contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. The EGR valve, in conjunction with the venturi and ECU, allows a controlled amount of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold to mix with the incoming fresh air. Replacing excess oxygen with cooled exhaust gas leads to lower combustion temperatures, creating less NOx. In addition, EGR allows for advanced timing, leading to optimal performance of the engine, maximizing fuel economy.",
      "Flow of exhaust during engine operationExhaust airflow enters into the EGR cooler from the exhaust manifold near the turbocharger.",
      "Based on engine load, air temperatures, and rpm, the ECU opens or closes the EGR valve, allowing a measured percentage of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper. A secondary lowering function accumulator is included with the hydraulic valves so the scraper can be lowered if hydraulic power is lost.",

The engine control unit (ECU) and exhaust temperature management (ETM) system work together to continuously regenerate the exhaust filter using a natural cleaning process sometimes referred to as passive regeneration.",
      "If natural filter cleaning cannot be achieved based on temperature, load, and speed, then particulate matter (PM) must be removed using an automatic cleaning process sometimes referred to as active regeneration. In most cases, filter cleaning does not impact machine operation or require operator involvement. Higher pressures created by our Final Tier 4 (FT4)/Stage IV high-pressure fuel system extend intervals between automatic cleanings.",
      "How EGR worksEGR reduces the high temperatures where nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds are formed in the engine cylinders by replacing excess oxygen with a prescribed amount of cooled exhaust gas.",
      "Exhaust gases contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. The EGR valve, in conjunction with the venturi and ECU, allows a controlled amount of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold to mix with the incoming fresh air. Replacing excess oxygen with cooled exhaust gas leads to lower combustion temperatures, creating less NOx. In addition, EGR allows for advanced timing, leading to optimal performance of the engine, maximizing fuel economy.",
      "Flow of exhaust during engine operationExhaust airflow enters into the EGR cooler from the exhaust manifold near the turbocharger.",
      "Based on engine load, air temperatures, and rpm, the ECU opens or closes the EGR valve, allowing a measured percentage of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold.",
      "The gases mix with the rest of the incoming air from the turbocharger and aftercooler before entering the cylinders.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper.

      "The electrical system provides a full controller area network (CAN) bus based system on the tractor for improved tractor implement integration and flexibility. Incorporated with the system is a smart load center, which provides fewer fuses, fewer connectors, and simplified wiring for increased reliability. The solid-state load center's primary function is to control the majority of high-current loads, such as fender floodlights and the horn. This electronic circuitry will monitor loads and voltages to provide fast reaction time and the ability to alert the operator if a circuit overloads or if voltage is out of specification - for example, open circuit (undercurrent) or short circuit (overcurrent).",

The engine control unit (ECU) and exhaust temperature management (ETM) system work together to continuously regenerate the exhaust filter using a natural cleaning process sometimes referred to as passive regeneration.",
      "If natural filter cleaning cannot be achieved based on temperature, load, and speed, then particulate matter (PM) must be removed using an automatic cleaning process sometimes referred to as active regeneration. In most cases, filter cleaning does not impact machine operation or require operator involvement. Higher pressures created by our Final Tier 4 (FT4)/Stage IV high-pressure fuel system extend intervals between automatic cleanings.",
      "How EGR worksEGR reduces the high temperatures where nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds are formed in the engine cylinders by replacing excess oxygen with a prescribed amount of cooled exhaust gas.",
      "Exhaust gases contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. The EGR valve, in conjunction with the venturi and ECU, allows a controlled amount of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold to mix with the incoming fresh air. Replacing excess oxygen with cooled exhaust gas leads to lower combustion temperatures, creating less NOx. In addition, EGR allows for advanced timing, leading to optimal performance of the engine, maximizing fuel economy.",
      "Flow of exhaust during engine operationExhaust airflow enters into the EGR cooler from the exhaust manifold near the turbocharger.",
      "Based on engine load, air temperatures, and rpm, the ECU opens or closes the EGR valve, allowing a measured percentage of exhaust gas to enter the intake manifold.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper.

Extensive work has been done between John Deere and Cummins on software development and other engine/tractor application interface points to provide producers with the performance and efficiency they have come to expect from John Deere.The X15 has followed the same building block approach to meet emissions requirements as similar John Deere engines. This allows John Deere to provide common technologies to producers throughout different horsepower and engine displacement offerings ensuring a consistent experience for producers. Just like the other two engine offerings in the 9 Family of tractors, the X15 features exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and an exhaust aftertreatment combination of a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to meet the near-zero NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions standards.X15 technologyXPI fuel system - the XPI common-rail fuel system delivers a precise quantity of fuel at ultra-high pressures. This, together with electronic engine controls, enables multiple injection events per cycle. Flexibility in injection timing increases fuel economy and performance while decreasing exhaust emissions.VGT turbocharger - the X15 utilizes a single Cummins VGT™ turbocharger which features electric actuation for infinite adjustment.Cooled EGR -system has been rebalanced for use with SCR, reducing flow volume and minimizing diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) consumption levels.Fully integrated electronic controls - a single electronic control module (ECM) controls everything from air intake to exhaust aftertreatment.Cummins particulate filter and SCR - Cummins particulate filter operates as a nearly passive device, with minimal regeneration required.Cummins and VGT are a trademarks of Cummins Inc.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper.

      "John Deere and Cummins have partnered to provide customers with a reliable, productive and efficient engine solution in the X15. Extensive work has been done between John Deere and Cummins on software development and other engine/tractor application interface points to provide producers with the performance and efficiency they have come to expect from John Deere.The X15 has followed the same building block approach to meet emissions requirements as similar John Deere engines. This allows John Deere to provide common technologies to producers throughout different horsepower and engine displacement offerings ensuring a consistent experience for producers. Just like the other two engine offerings in the 9 Family of tractors, the X15 features exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and an exhaust aftertreatment combination of a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to meet the near-zero NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions standards.X15 technologyXPI fuel system - the XPI common-rail fuel system delivers a precise quantity of fuel at ultra-high pressures. This, together with electronic engine controls, enables multiple injection events per cycle. Flexibility in injection timing increases fuel economy and performance while decreasing exhaust emissions.VGT turbocharger - the X15 utilizes a single Cummins VGT™ turbocharger which features electric actuation for infinite adjustment.Cooled EGR -system has been rebalanced for use with SCR, reducing flow volume and minimizing diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) consumption levels.Fully integrated electronic controls - a single electronic control module (ECM) controls everything from air intake to exhaust aftertreatment.Cummins particulate filter and SCR - Cummins particulate filter operates as a nearly passive device, with minimal regeneration required.Cummins and VGT are a trademarks of Cummins Inc.",

The control layout of the CommandARM utilizes a clean and efficient design which groups controls by function and builds upon John Deere's history of intuitive and ergonomic control placement and operation. The design of the CommandARM allows for a 40-degree right seat swivel and adjustable positioning matching the operator's preference.",

      "ThrottleThe throttle design incorporates buttons which control FieldCruise speed, and transmission eco settings.",

      "Controls for radio, lights, rotary beacon (if equipped), hazard flashers, and HVAC system are located to the center-right on the CommandARM, along with power take-off (PTO) for rear PTO.",
      "Seat swivelThe design of the CommandARM allows for up to 40 degrees of right-hand seat swivel.",

      "The Generation 4 CommandCenter systems have the capability of Remote Display Access (RDA). RDA allows improved communication between an offsite farm manager or dealer and the equipment operator. The user can view exactly what the operator sees on the GreenStar™ 3 2630 Display and Generation 4 CommandCenter from almost any internet-connected device. RDA is available on the 4600 and 4100 CommandCenter and allows for an increase in productivity with quicker problem resolution. By using RDA, the cost of operation will decrease due to reduced labor and travel costs, and maximum efficiency will increase profit.",
      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper. A secondary lowering function accumulator is included with the hydraulic valves so the scraper can be lowered if hydraulic power is lost.",
      "NOTE: This system is not recommended with agricultural implements with continuous flow demand (scraper applications only).",
      "IMPORTANT: Do not use this system with scrapers/implements with 12.7-mm (1/2-in.) couplers/hoses/hydraulic systems. Damage could occur to implement hoses/couplers/components due to high-flow capability of the tractor system.",
      "NOTE: Power Beyond connections are not recommended for use with scraper systems or high hydraulic oil take out demand (example: large or multiple single acting cylinders, raising multiple scraper pans).

Extensive work has been done between John Deere and Cummins on software development and other engine/tractor application interface points to provide producers with the performance and efficiency they have come to expect from John Deere.The X15 has followed the same building block approach to meet emissions requirements as similar John Deere engines. This allows John Deere to provide common technologies to producers throughout different horsepower and engine displacement offerings ensuring a consistent experience for producers. Just like the other two engine offerings in the 9 Family of tractors, the X15 features exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and an exhaust aftertreatment combination of a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to meet the near-zero NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions standards.X15 technologyXPI fuel system - the XPI common-rail fuel system delivers a precise quantity of fuel at ultra-high pressures. This, together with electronic engine controls, enables multiple injection events per cycle. Flexibility in injection timing increases fuel economy and performance while decreasing exhaust emissions.VGT turbocharger - the X15 utilizes a single Cummins VGT™ turbocharger which features electric actuation for infinite adjustment.Cooled EGR -system has been rebalanced for use with SCR, reducing flow volume and minimizing diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) consumption levels.Fully integrated electronic controls - a single electronic control module (ECM) controls everything from air intake to exhaust aftertreatment.Cummins particulate filter and SCR - Cummins particulate filter operates as a nearly passive device, with minimal regeneration required.Cummins and VGT are a trademarks of Cummins Inc.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper.

      "John Deere and Cummins have partnered to provide customers with a reliable, productive and efficient engine solution in the X15. Extensive work has been done between John Deere and Cummins on software development and other engine/tractor application interface points to provide producers with the performance and efficiency they have come to expect from John Deere.The X15 has followed the same building block approach to meet emissions requirements as similar John Deere engines. This allows John Deere to provide common technologies to producers throughout different horsepower and engine displacement offerings ensuring a consistent experience for producers. Just like the other two engine offerings in the 9 Family of tractors, the X15 features exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and an exhaust aftertreatment combination of a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to meet the near-zero NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions standards.X15 technologyXPI fuel system - the XPI common-rail fuel system delivers a precise quantity of fuel at ultra-high pressures. This, together with electronic engine controls, enables multiple injection events per cycle. Flexibility in injection timing increases fuel economy and performance while decreasing exhaust emissions.VGT turbocharger - the X15 utilizes a single Cummins VGT™ turbocharger which features electric actuation for infinite adjustment.Cooled EGR -system has been rebalanced for use with SCR, reducing flow volume and minimizing diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) consumption levels.Fully integrated electronic controls - a single electronic control module (ECM) controls everything from air intake to exhaust aftertreatment.Cummins particulate filter and SCR - Cummins particulate filter operates as a nearly passive device, with minimal regeneration required.Cummins and VGT are a trademarks of Cummins Inc.",

      "The e18 transmission delivers smooth shifting and intuitive controls in a reliable 18-speed PowerShift transmission. The e18 transmission with enhanced Efficiency Manager is standard equipment on all 9 Family Tractors.The e18 has evolved from more than 50 years of John Deere PowerShift technology. With more automatic features, the e18 is easy to operate for all levels of operators and operations. It features three modes of operation, full AUTO, custom, and manual modes. Full AUTO and custom modes manage the engine and transmission to match the desired ground speed to the field conditions. These two modes are ideal for most conditions and take the guess work out of operation. Manual mode is perfect for operators looking to operate the e18 like a traditional PowerShift by bump shifting and managing the engine throttle to their liking.As the next generation of PowerShift technology, the e18 delivers the strength to handle sudden, high-torque power loads while maintaining responsive, quick, and smooth shifts.",
      "The CommandCenter is the central information system for tractors and allows the operator to program various settings tailored to a specific operation.To access the tractor's transmission settings, press the transmission shortcut button on the CommandCenter shortcut bar.",
      "Operating modesThe e18 application settings employ three modes to take full advantage of the engine-transmission communication: Full AUTO mode, custom mode, and manual mode.",
      "Full AUTO mode manages the tractor's engine and transmission inputs to reach and maintain the desired ground speed set by the operator. This means the tractor will manage shifts and engine rpm to operate at the most efficient level possible. Operators have the ability to set the maximum forward and reverse speeds for their particular applications. In full AUTO mode the operator can adjust the desired ground speed in two ways, by conducting a traditional bump shift or by rotating the dial on the thumb wheel.When shifting in full AUTO mode, the transmission shifts set speeds and does not always shift gears, meaning the transmission may not necessarily shift gears if it can reach the desired ground speed with a slightly higher or lower engine rpm. Efficiency Manager is automatically engaged while operating in full AUTO mode. As a result, shifting will not take the tractor out of Efficiency Manager in full AUTO mode.",
      "Custom mode operates similar to full AUTO mode but allows operators to adjust operating parameters to meet a specific operation. It also has the ability to activate eco mode for a higher level of operation.",
      "Eco allows two minimum engine speeds to be set. Operators can turn eco on and off by either pushing the eco button on the side of the throttle or by selecting eco in the transmission settings page of the CommandCenter controls. For example, operators may choose to turn eco on during transport to utilize a lower minimum engine speed and then turn eco off while operating in the field where a higher minimum engine speed is desired.",
      "In the advanced settings page, operators can customize the auto shift engine speed droop as a percentage of the full engine speed. In addition, the load anticipation feature can be enabled for the hitch engagement, hydraulic engagement, or both.Manual modeManual mode operates very similarly to a traditional PowerShift transmission with Efficiency Manager.In manual mode the operator manages the engine and transmission inputs by controlling the shift lever and hand throttle.",
      "Efficiency Manager is automatically enabled in auto and custom modes. Efficiency Manager can be turned on in manual mode by selecting the set speed one or set speed two button on the CommandARM™ console. The set speed adjuster on the top of the single-lever gear selector allows the operator to dial in the desired ground speed to establish set speed one or two. Once engaged, Efficiency Manager will manage the engine rpm and gear selection to maintain the desired working speed. To reach the desired set speed, the throttle must be set to full engine rpm.",
      "Setting start-up gearsThe 9 Family Tractors default to 7F and 2R at start up. However, these default start-up gears can be adjusted from 1-13F and 1-3R through the CommandCenter. Refer to the operator's manual for additional information.",

      "The 115-gpm (435 L/min) hydraulic system (order code 2813) is designed to reduce scraper hydraulic cycle times, thus increasing the efficiency of the tractor/scraper combination. Two hydraulic pumps are combined for a total of 115-gpm (435 L/min). Flow through one 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) SCV is 45 gpm (140 L/min). The selective control valves (SCVs) are designed for commercial applications. This system is not recommended for agricultural implements with continuous flow requirements. When maximum hydraulic pump capacity is reached, multiple functions will continue to operate at the same proportional flow rate. This will prevent the rear scraper from slowing down, in relation to the front scraper, when operating the front and rear scrapers at the same time. When ordering this scraper high-flow option, the tractor will come standard with four SCVs. The two system pumps provide their combined oil flow of 115 gpm (435 L/min) to all four SCVs through a common valve manifold. All of the SCV oil returns to one common reservoir. 19.1-mm (3/4-in.) couplers reduce restriction for increased flow to the scraper. A secondary lowering function accumulator is included with the hydraulic valves so the scraper can be lowered if hydraulic power is lost.",

      "The John Deere scraper system is an independent earthmoving system requiring one operator to load, transport, and spread the materials on a job site. Self-propelled and truck/excavator earthmoving systems need additional support equipment to assist with loading and spreading the materials, increasing labor requirements.",

Heavily shielded hydraulic lines, cylinders, and components provide protection when top loading needs arise. When conditions do not allow for direct loading, John Deere scraper systems can provide as much as 80 tons per cycle in top loading capacity with triples.",
      "Top-loading produces a force caused by the weight of the material falling into the scraper.

      "Bowl width 3.7 m (12 ft. 0 in.)",
      "Throughout the world, contractors have been moving material with conventional self-propelled scrapers or rigid/articulated trucks and excavators. John Deere scraper tractors and scrapers are a valuable solution for contractors, allowing them to move the same material using half the labor, half the investment, and saving 30 cents per cu yd to 50 cents per cu yd.",
      "Half the labor",
      "The John Deere scraper system is an independent earthmoving system requiring one operator to load, transport, and spread the materials on a job site. Self-propelled and truck/excavator earthmoving systems need additional support equipment to assist with loading and spreading the materials, increasing labor requirements.",
      "Half the investment",
      "Compare the purchase price of a John Deere scraper tractor and scrapers to competitive systems. Factor in the labor costs, fuel burn, daily operating expenses of all the equipment used in the system, and it all adds up to half the savings over the life of the equipment.",
      "Saving 30 to 50 cents per cu yd",
      "The savings are already adding up with the reduced labor requirements and lower investment costs. Experience additional savings from reduced fuel consumption by having only one tractor engine performing all of the work. Increase productivity moving more yards per cycle when using the 16-m3 or 18.3-m3 (21-cu yd or 24-cu yd) scrapers in tandem or triple configurations.",
      "Applications for the John Deere scraper systems are as follows:",
      "An innovation in the earthmoving industry exclusive to John Deere, the AutoLoad feature allows novice and experienced operators alike to be consistently productive while operating John Deere tractors and scrapers with the touch of a button, even if they have never operated tractors and scrapers.",
      "John Deere scrapers are designed to handle the harsh conditions of top-loading scrapers. The updated swept-back design to the top off the ejector wall provides a better, unobstructed bowl opening. Heavily shielded hydraulic lines, cylinders, and components provide protection when top loading needs arise. When conditions do not allow for direct loading, John Deere scraper systems can provide as much as 80 tons per cycle in top loading capacity with triples.",
      "Top-loading produces a force caused by the weight of the material falling into the scraper. With the scraper sitting on the ground, this force travels into the ground through the frame of the scraper. If the scraper is in the raised position, the force could cause extreme hydraulic pressure spikes, which can severely damage the hydraulic system of the scraper tractor and scraper.",
      "During top loading procedure, make sure the scraper blade is lowered and resting on the ground.",
      "Top-loading scrapers in the raised position could void the scraper warranty.",
      "Sometimes, harsh conditions call for a little extra power. In the world of self-propelled scrapers, push loading with a crawler is a way of life.",
      "While John Deere pull-type scrapers can direct load in almost any condition, the ability to push load has been built into the design of the ejector line to give earthmovers the additional versatility to which they are accustomed. Rock, hard pan, or heavy gumbos are just a few of the conditions where a crawler assist can keep the dirt moving.",
      "Push loading is approved in single, tandem, and triple ejector trains where a rear scraper extended rear bumper is employed. The 2010D E and 2412D E two-tire models feature an integrated push block standard.",
      "The iGrade controller enables and automates new water management applications, as well as John Deere's existing water management tool, Surface Water Pro™ Plus system. iGrade offers the ability to generate a basic plane and grade, as well as perform distance-based tasks - all while automatically controlling the height of the scraper blade.",
      "iGrade provides four applications to complete different tasks:",
      "The iGrade controller works with many of the different John Deere Precision Ag Technology components producers may already own, such as:",
      "iGrade is approved for the following platforms:",
      "NOTE: iGrade requires the receiver to have a real-time kinetic (RTK) signal level. iGrade does not support wide-area augmentation system (WAAS), SF1, or SF2 signal levels.",
      "In both large- and small-scale jobs for commercial and residential applications, John Deere scraper systems shine. From 41.3 m3 to 13.8 m3 (54 cu yd to 18 cu yd), with the pull of a pin, John Deere scrapers make it versatile enough for contractors who work in a broad range of job types.",
      "John Deere scrapers are a valuable part of any construction fleet, whether as the primary mover or a complement to other equipment. Scrapers excavate, carry, spread, and grade material, making it the most efficient and versatile machine on any job site.",
      "John Deere scraper systems are not just for precision laser land leveling. A sophisticated suite of precision agriculture products is offered, including iGrade for land leveling and Surface Water Pro™ Plus system for ditching and levee building.",
      "The scrapers are also perfect for cattle feed lot maintenance, grain bin foundations, waterway topsoil reclamation, commercial ponds, and much more. Anywhere material needs to be moved, John Deere scrapers provide a solution that can excavate, carry, and grade material with one operator, one implement, and one tractor. This gives the grower or contractor a level of efficiency that cannot be achieved with most traditional construction equipment.",
      "Just as contractors have adopted scrapers for their exemplary cost and productivity, miners look for greater efficiency when moving dirt or mined material. Scrapers are an excellent way to strip and reclaim overburden in pit mines or to simply haul stockpiled mined material such as coal.",
      "John Deere scrapers are built to handle the most unique materials - nimble enough to handle light materials like coal yet rugged enough for heavier materials like wet sea salt.",
      "John Deere scraper systems are perfect for building and covering landfill cells in waste management applications. Waste management companies have experienced tremendous savings by trading in their trucks and excavators for the John Deere scraper system.",
      "Scrapers not only do a great job of creating a cell, but their ability to spread material on grade make it ideal for covering waste. The gang of tires compact the material as it is unloaded and will not destroy haul roads. The scraper's heavy-duty, rock-lug tires can handle the hazardous conditions found in a landfill. When heavy-garbage trucks deteriorate the offloading ramp, use the scraper blade to grade and rebuild it.",

      "PowerTech™ EPA Final Tier 4 (FT4)/EU Stage IV engine coupled with a hybrid-electric drive can provide significant fuel savings over 9-cu.-yd. loaders with conventional drivetrains.",
      "The FT4 update reduces fuel consumption by 9 to 14 percent over EPA Interim Tier 4 (IT4)/EU Stage IIIB models.",
      "Flow-sharing hydraulic system boasts the fastest cycle times and the quickest boom-raise time in the 944K's size class, speeding short-pattern truck loading. Each boom and bucket function has its own hydraulic pump for quick, smooth operation, and faster truck loading.",
      "Front fender has been cut back to enable greater visibility to the front tire, so the operator can see when slippage occurs. Fender extensions are available.",
      "Engine runs at a choice of three constant operator-selected rpms, so boom and bucket functions are powerful, responsive, and quick, while optimum fuel efficiency is maintained. Reduces overall machine noise and operator fatigue.",
      "Hybrid-electric drive smoothly and efficiently recaptures energy to slow the loader when the operator lets off the accelerator. This lessens the load on the engine and reduces fuel consumption.",
      "Generators, brake resistors, wheel motors, and inverters are warranted for 8 years or 20,000 hours, whichever occurs first.*",
      "Quad-Cool design places coolers in a boxed configuration that's isolated from engine heat, for increased efficiency and durability.",
      "Coast-control feature functions like dynamic braking in a hydrostatic transmission, slowing the loader without touching a pedal and helping reduce service-brake component wear.",
      "Joystick steering adapts to ground speed to deliver smooth, low-effort control, for fatigue-beating comfort. F-N-R switch with up- and downshift buttons ensures fast, smooth shifting and directional changes. Having no steering wheel maximizes visibility to the front.",
      "At 10-in. wider than the next smaller Deere loader, this quieter, more spacious cab is the largest in its class. Cooler compartment and beverage holder ensure plenty of room to stow your stuff. Floor-to-ceiling front glass provides a commanding view to the bucket and tires.",
      "At only 107 dBA, noise is much less noticeable to bystanders than with other loaders, making this loader a good neighbor. For the operator, cab noise is only 71 dBA.",
      "All daily service points including fueling are grouped for quick and convenient ground-level access.",
      "The 944K is available with four bucket options, a 6.88-m3 (9.0 cu. yd) spade-nose rock bucket, 6.5-m3 (8.5 cu. yd) heavy-duty granite spade-nose rock bucket, a 7.65-m3 (10 cu. yd.) general-purpose pin-on bucket or a less bucket option.",
      "Four standard tie-off points are located on top of the cab above each ROPS post that meet MSHA and OSHA requirements. The operator or technician can simply remove the bolt and install their safety device while performing service on the 944K."
