            "Preparing the perfect seedbed is the key to improving your field's chances of increasing yields. A firm, level seedbed allows for better seed to soil contact, which results in faster germination and uniform emergence. Proper seedbed preparation helps warm up the soil for earlier planting and a longer growing season. For maximum efficiency and versatility, the new 8530 is engineered to pull easy, maintain a uniform working depth, and allow for smooth and even residue flow in the toughest of field conditions.",
            "New Features",
            "The 8500 Finisholl hydraulically folds for narrow transport widths and manageable transport heights and provides outstanding out-of-ground clearance. Moving from field to field is made easy! The self-leveling hitch maintains the adjusted front-to-rear frame setting at any operating depth and directs positive weight onto the tractor drawbar regardless of the finishing attachment that is chosen. The user-friendly single point depth control simplifies setting the operating depth and provides precise depth control for the ultimate in finish operations.",

The smooth cutting edge of this blade has proven to wear sharper and penetrate better than fluted or wavy blades. In wet, sticky conditions, the smooth surface sheds residue better.",
            "A \"split the middle\" shank pattern is used for shank placement allowing for 8\" spacing with 9\" sweeps. Two styles of shanks are offered: s-tine shanks or spring clamp shanks. The two-piece s-tine shanks are geared for rock-free soils, feature 190 lb. point load and will accommodate any sweep with a 47-degree stem angle. The spring clamp shanks feature 190 lb. point load, 10\" trip height, and a three-year warranty.",

The 24' working width is geared towards producers with mid-size row crop tractors who are looking for more seeding capacity than that of the 12' Brillion Seeder but yet do not have the horsepower to pull the large 36' model.",

The 4620-24 seeder wings float 5 degrees left to right and 5 degrees front to rear on torsion springs to follow the ground's contours and further enhance germination rates.",

            "Basic straight cut coulters on a weighted gang in the front of the unit cut and size the residue. The chisel shanks, spaced on 15\" centers and equipped with twisted chisel points, engage the soil and mix and blend the sized residue into an acceptable medium for preventing erosion and conserving moisture. These tools will leave the surface ridged to allow more surface to be available to the sunlight for the better dry down and warm up before the next planting season.",
            "Brillion CD Models",
            "The CD models are the original Soil Builders. A single, manually adjustable gang of coulters with 7  1/2 \" spacing in the front of the machine starts the tillage process. Two ranks of chisel shanks are supported on a weighted frame that allows for 15\" shank spacing. The shank and coulter spacing allow one coulter to lead each shank and have one coulter in between each shank for optimum soil breakout and residue flow. The CD series is available in 5 and 7 shank models. These machines fit very well with 100 to 150 HP tractors in most conditions.",
            "Brillion HSB Models",
            "The HSB series is the next generation of Soil Builders. Many of the proven components and features from the CD series have been incorporated into the HSB models. The coulter gangs have remained unchanged other than they are hydraulically controlled. The chisel shanks are mounted to a 3-rank frame for added residue capacity. The lift axle is controlled with a single depth stop cylinder. Walking tandems are available on the larger units. The hitch is longer to accommodate larger tractors with dual tires. The HSB models are available in 7, 9, 11, and 13 shank models. Horsepower requirements are 15 to 20 HP per shank.",

            "Providing a Solution",
            "Many dryland farming customers have experienced the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds and are looking for alternative methods or tools for weed control. Landoll has stepped up to that challenge and offers the 1700 Series Blade Plow as a solution for superior weed control for dryland farming operations. The Blade Plow is built tough to last and is designed with the user in mind; keeping the plow running level is key and all leveling adjustments on the 1700 Series are easy and user-friendly.",
            "How It Works",
            "The 1700 Series Blade Plow features 22\" coulters up front to cut residue ahead of the 6' wide blades that slice through any weed roots beneath the soil surface. The soil surface is virtually undisturbed and the rolling treaders on the rear of the machine grab any shallow-rooted weeds and rip them out of the soil getting them away from any available moisture.",
            "The rolling treaders are aggressive enough to pull up those small weeds and loosened roots and create a layer of mulch on top of the soil surface. This loose mulch helps conserve moisture under the area the plow has sliced through the soil creating a thermal barrier. Weed control and moisture conservation in one tool!",
            "Easy Leveling",
            "The 1700 Series Blade Plow is carried on radial tires with heavy-duty 8-bolt hubs and 3\" slip-in spindles. Not only does the Landoll Blade Plow have more load capacity than competitive models, but keeping the plow running level is much easier with consistent tire sizes across the width of the machine.",
            "All cylinders are located on top of the frame and are easy to access for making adjustments. The ability to precisely level the plow allows for a shallower depth of operation. The over-the-top hitch design controls front to rear rotational forces, further helping keep the plow level. The hitch aids in penetrating hard ground conditions and has positive tongue weight to keep the plow in the ground when the treaders are raised.",
            "Built To Last",
            "The 6' wide cutting blades on the Blade Plow are hard-surfaced to enhance wearability. The same size blades are used across the width of the unit to help with the consistency of parts. The teeth on the treaders are also hard-surfaced to last longer.",
            "The 1700 Series is built with enough strength to stay together; 5\" x 4\" x 3/8\" frame tubes are used on the front of the frame. A maintenance-free 3-hinge system is used on all sections for added durability, along with maintenance-free lift axles. The Landoll Blade Plow is durable to handle adverse conditions and is built to last...that's Landoll way.",

The rear shank mount bolt is the pivot; the front shank mount bolt is the shear bolt. When an obstruction is encountered, the front bolt will shear and the shank will trip rearward to clear the obstruction. The machine must then be raised out of the soil, the shank returned to position and a new shear bolt installed. This is a very user-friendly procedure to minimize downtime in the field. The Sub Soiler is designed to operate at a maximum depth of 16\". Since maximum horsepower requirements are limited to 120 HP, these units are designed for small to medium size operations. These machines are close coupled to the tractor with a three-point hitch.",

            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "Stability with Top Performance and Maneuverability",
            "The Model 455B Traveling Axle trailer will handle heavy loads with triple axles and 55-ton capacity. Lengths available are 48', 50', 53', 57' and California legal 50'. To maximize the load capacity, the 455B is standard with a 60\" axle spread.",
            "Increased frame capacity is one of the outstanding features of the 455B along with wider main beams, wider undercarriage, wider tilt cylinder mounts and wider outer beam pivot points. Buying a Landoll means you get the total package of super low load angle, ease and safety of operation, superior quality and the highest retained resale value in the market today.",
            "Low Clearance Upper Deck Transition",
            "All 400 series trailers feature the super low clearance slope transition allowing man lifts, forklifts, and other difficult low clearance equipment to load easily on the upper deck.",
            "Ultimate Stability",
            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, and outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",
            "Powder Coat Paint",
            "Landoll is the only trailer manufacturer to offer powder coat paint on an entire trailer frame.

            "The Landoll Trailer Line is taking a huge leap forward with the introduction of the all-new hydraulic operating systems, nicknamed H.O.S.S. and High Visibility Lighting package.",
            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "Stability with Top Performance and Maneuverability",
            "The Model 455B Traveling Axle trailer will handle heavy loads with triple axles and 55-ton capacity. Lengths available are 48', 50', 53', 57' and California legal 50'. To maximize the load capacity, the 455B is standard with a 60\" axle spread.",
            "Increased frame capacity is one of the outstanding features of the 455B along with wider main beams, wider undercarriage, wider tilt cylinder mounts and wider outer beam pivot points. Buying a Landoll means you get the total package of super low load angle, ease and safety of operation, superior quality and the highest retained resale value in the market today.",
            "Low Clearance Upper Deck Transition",
            "All 400 series trailers feature the super low clearance slope transition allowing man lifts, forklifts, and other difficult low clearance equipment to load easily on the upper deck.",
            "Ultimate Stability",
            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, and outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",
            "Powder Coat Paint",
            "Landoll is the only trailer manufacturer to offer powder coat paint on an entire trailer frame. The very durable finish provides excellent chemical and salt resistance while giving Landoll trailers a high quality, attractive appearance. A zinc-rich powder primer is applied prior to painting the entire frame with one of eight standard powder coat colors.",

            "The Landoll Trailer Line is taking a huge leap forward with the introduction of the all-new hydraulic operating systems, nicknamed H.O.S.S. and High Visibility Lighting package.",
            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "Stability with Top Performance and Maneuverability",
            "The Model 455B Traveling Axle trailer will handle heavy loads with triple axles and 55-ton capacity. Lengths available are 48', 50', 53', 57' and California legal 50'. To maximize the load capacity, the 455B is standard with a 60\" axle spread.",
            "Increased frame capacity is one of the outstanding features of the 455B along with wider main beams, wider undercarriage, wider tilt cylinder mounts and wider outer beam pivot points. Buying a Landoll means you get the total package of super low load angle, ease and safety of operation, superior quality and the highest retained resale value in the market today.",
            "Low Clearance Upper Deck Transition",
            "All 400 series trailers feature the super low clearance slope transition allowing man lifts, forklifts, and other difficult low clearance equipment to load easily on the upper deck.",
            "Ultimate Stability",
            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, and outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",
            "Powder Coat Paint",
            "Landoll is the only trailer manufacturer to offer powder coat paint on an entire trailer frame. The very durable finish provides excellent chemical and salt resistance while giving Landoll trailers a high quality, attractive appearance. A zinc-rich powder primer is applied prior to painting the entire frame with one of eight standard powder coat colors.",

            "The Landoll Trailer Line is taking a huge leap forward with the introduction of the all-new hydraulic operating systems, nicknamed H.O.S.S. and High Visibility Lighting package.",
            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "Stability with Top Performance and Maneuverability",
            "The Model 455B Traveling Axle trailer will handle heavy loads with triple axles and 55-ton capacity. Lengths available are 48', 50', 53', 57' and California legal 50'. To maximize the load capacity, the 455B is standard with a 60\" axle spread.",
            "Increased frame capacity is one of the outstanding features of the 455B along with wider main beams, wider undercarriage, wider tilt cylinder mounts and wider outer beam pivot points. Buying a Landoll means you get the total package of super low load angle, ease and safety of operation, superior quality and the highest retained resale value in the market today.",
            "Low Clearance Upper Deck Transition",
            "All 400 series trailers feature the super low clearance slope transition allowing man lifts, forklifts, and other difficult low clearance equipment to load easily on the upper deck.",
            "Ultimate Stability",
            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, and outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",
            "Powder Coat Paint",
            "Landoll is the only trailer manufacturer to offer powder coat paint on an entire trailer frame.

A zinc-rich powder primer is applied prior to painting the entire frame with one of eight standard powder coat colors.",

            "The Next Generation Landoll Trailer has Arrived!",
            "The Landoll Trailer Line is taking a huge leap forward with the introduction of the all-new hydraulic operating systems, nicknamed H.O.S.S. and High Visibility Lighting package.",
            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "Stability with Top Performance and Maneuverability",
            "The Model 455B Traveling Axle trailer will handle heavy loads with triple axles and 55-ton capacity. Lengths available are 48', 50', 53', 57' and California legal 50'. To maximize the load capacity, the 455B is standard with a 60\" axle spread.",
            "Increased frame capacity is one of the outstanding features of the 455B along with wider main beams, wider undercarriage, wider tilt cylinder mounts and wider outer beam pivot points. Buying a Landoll means you get the total package of super low load angle, ease and safety of operation, superior quality and the highest retained resale value in the market today.",
            "Low Clearance Upper Deck Transition",
            "All 400 series trailers feature the super low clearance slope transition allowing man lifts, forklifts, and other difficult low clearance equipment to load easily on the upper deck.",
            "Ultimate Stability",
            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, and outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",
            "Powder Coat Paint",
            "Landoll is the only trailer manufacturer to offer powder coat paint on an entire trailer frame.

            "Landoll's patented neck has a single hydraulic function. The neck operation is one hydraulic lever which fully detaches and carries the neck away from the lower deck. Reconnecting is just as easy. Back up and the alignment wedge centers the neck and the \"A\" frame load carrier relocks the lower deck and lifts the trailer to transport position. Choose one of seven ride heights to adjust to the proper transport position.",
            "Flexibility",
            "Drivers need flexibility while loading. With bigger equipment, it's necessary to make loading onto the lower deck trouble-free. From a clean assist ramp for larger equipment to the fully Hydraulic Power Ramp loading forklifts, pavers and rollers, Landoll gives you the ability to load just about anything just inches from the ground.",
            "Safety-High-Visibility Lighting",
            "Landoll, working in collaboration with Grote Industries, offers new LED diode maker lights to maximize the luminous output with up to 22 lights on every trailer. The rear-facing DOT lights have also been enhanced by adding the fourth tail-turn light to the mud flap bracket. This high visibility light package has substantially increased awareness and is standard equipment on all 400 and 800 series trailers.",

            "Patented Neck",
            "Landoll's patented neck has a single hydraulic function. The neck operation is one hydraulic lever which fully detaches and carries the neck away from the lower deck. Reconnecting is just as easy. Back up and the alignment wedge centers the neck and the \"A\" frame load carrier relocks the lower deck and lifts the trailer to transport position. Choose one of seven ride heights to adjust to the proper transport position.",
            "Flexibility",
            "Drivers need flexibility while loading. With bigger equipment, it's necessary to make loading onto the lower deck trouble-free. From a clean assist ramp for larger equipment to the fully Hydraulic Power Ramp loading forklifts, pavers and rollers, Landoll gives you the ability to load just about anything just inches from the ground.",
            "Safety-High-Visibility Lighting",
            "Landoll, working in collaboration with Grote Industries, offers new LED diode maker lights to maximize the luminous output with up to 22 lights on every trailer. The rear-facing DOT lights have also been enhanced by adding the fourth tail-turn light to the mud flap bracket. This high visibility light package has substantially increased awareness and is standard equipment on all 400 and 800 series trailers.",

            "Landoll's patented neck has a single hydraulic function. The neck operation is one hydraulic lever which fully detaches and carries the neck away from the lower deck. Reconnecting is just as easy. Back up and the alignment wedge centers the neck and the \"A\" frame load carrier relocks the lower deck and lifts the trailer to transport position. Choose one of seven ride heights to adjust to the proper transport position.",
            "Flexibility",
            "Drivers need flexibility while loading. With bigger equipment, it's necessary to make loading onto the lower deck trouble-free. From a clean assist ramp for larger equipment to the fully Hydraulic Power Ramp loading forklifts, pavers and rollers, Landoll gives you the ability to load just about anything just inches from the ground.",
            "Safety-High-Visibility Lighting",
            "Landoll, working in collaboration with Grote Industries, offers new LED diode maker lights to maximize the luminous output with up to 22 lights on every trailer. The rear-facing DOT lights have also been enhanced by adding the fourth tail-turn light to the mud flap bracket. This high visibility light package has substantially increased awareness and is standard equipment on all 400 and 800 series trailers.",

            "Updated Design but Proven Concept",
            "The coulter chisel concept has been used for decades as an alternative primary tillage practice. The newly redesigned Landoll 2100 Series Coulter Chisel incorporates this concept into high capacity. This translates to handling heavy residue at higher speeds with maximum efficiency. Cover more acres per hour using less horsepower per foot than conventional disc rippers.",
            "Available in sizes with 9 to 25 shanks allowing for cutting widths of 11'3\" to 31'3\", these models will work with a wide range of tractor sizes and provide ultimate productivity for nearly any operation. Residue is sized every 7  1/2 \" with the front 22\" cutting coulters. Compaction is eliminated and residue is blended in with the heavy-duty shanks spaced at 15\". Shanks are mounted on staggered bars allowing residue to easily flow through the machine. In addition, shanks are arranged to follow a coulter and have one in between each for optimum residue sizing.",
            "The high-clearance shanks offer 32\" of underframe clearance and are available in auto-reset or rigid shear bolt configurations. The auto-reset shank assemblies provide 1,750 pounds of point load, a 14\" trip height, and the point angle can be adjusted to 50 or 60 degrees. Twisted shovels or straight points are offered to complete the shank assemblies.",
            "User Friendly Features",
            "The 2100 Series Coulter Chisel offers single point depth control at the front of the machine. Hydraulically controlled coulters allow for \"on the go\" adjustments to meet changing conditions right from the comfort of the tractor cab. The self-leveling hitch provides a \"set it and forget it\" adjustment that maintains level operation from front to rear. The updated design features fewer moving parts to help reduce downtime in the field and adjustments are simple to make, further increasing efficiency.",
            "The newly redesigned 2100 Series now accommodates a combo tine and chopper leveling attachment. The combo attachment features three rows of hard surfaced laser stitched coil tine teeth placed on 4\" overall centers. The 5 bladed 16\" diameter chopper reel is spring cushioned and can be hydraulically raised out of the ground in wet and sticky conditions. The choppers are staggered for full overlap of the entire cutting width. This is the ultimate attachment for leveling and clod breaking capabilities leaving a smooth field finish.",
            "Reap Big Benefits",
            "Today's high yielding crops produce large amounts of heavy residue that must be sized and mixed in the soil to accelerate breakdown. The Landoll Coulter Chisel will perform the ultimate primary tillage pass, setting you up for increased yields the following season. Combine this with Landoll's state of the art manufacturing processes to have peace of mind that your 2100 Series Coulter Chisel will be in it for the long haul.",

            "The Landoll 9630/9650 Series Field Cultivator started with the need for efficiency. High residue levels, larger acreages, higher horsepower tractors and an ever-shrinking window of planting opportunities, the design team at Landoll had set the bar high. Customer feedback from today's top producers was used to eliminate the shortfalls found in competitive units. All aspects of ultimate seedbed preparation were taken into consideration in the new design of the 9600 Series Field Cultivator.",
            "It Starts with the Frame",
            "High capacity tillage tools need to have a solid foundation to build from. The Landoll 9630/9650 Series Field Cultivator uses precision, laser-cut structural steel frame members that are robotically welded for ultimate strength and reliability. This process of manufacturing provides the end-user with peace of mind that the Landoll 9600 Series Field Cultivator will be reliable day after day and season after season. The deep frame allows for a \"split the middle\" shank arrangement for unrestricted residue flow for perfect seedbed preparation. The frame is the anchor for the self-leveling hitch and walking tandem transport axles. The shanks are attached to 4\" x 3\" structural steel tubes that offer true 6\" shank spacing on all models.",
            "There's More",
            "UHMW polymer is used on all rock shaft bearing surfaces. This provides for maintenance-free operation in this high wear area. The lift circuit uses 10\" stroke phasing cylinders throughout for even raise/lower cycles. The cylinders use hardened bushings in all pivots and nickel and chrome-plated rods for extended life. Single point depth control at the front of the machine provides precise depth control in  1/4 \" increments. Pivoting wing gauge wheels are standard on the 28 through 50-foot models. 1  1/4 \" hinge pins on the wing fold operate on UHMW maintenance-free bushings.",

            "The shank is the heart of the Field Cultivator. Landoll offers two styles of shanks on 9600. The spring tension shanks offer up 190 lbs. of point load with a 10\" trip height, and 26  1/2 \" underframe clearance. 6\" spacing with standard 47 degrees 8\" sweeps will completely till the full width of the machine. The spring towers feature a Connex wear bushing. These bushings are Nitrotec(r) coated for increased wear and corrosion resistance. The clamp assemblies utilize laser cut components for ease of assembly. Extension style springs are used exclusively on all Landoll spring tension shanks. A two-piece s-tine shank assembly is also available as an option in rock free conditions. Like its counterpart, it has 190 lbs. of point load and uses 47-degree sweeps.",
            "The Landoll 9600 Series is available in sizes from 20' 6\" to 50' 6\". The 9630 models are 3 section units and the 9650 models are 5 section units. Horsepower requirements are in the 7 to 9 HP per foot range. The final field finish will be determined by which an optional leveling device is chosen. Choose between a 4-Row Coil Tine, 3-Row Coil Tine with Reel, 5-Row Spike and 3-Bar Spike with Reel. A rear hitch for towing additional implements is also available."

Reconnecting is just as easy. Back up and the alignment wedge centers the neck and the \"A\" frame load carrier relocks the lower deck and lifts the trailer to transport position. Choose one of seven ride heights to adjust to the proper transport position.",

From a clean assist ramp for larger equipment to the fully Hydraulic Power Ramp loading forklifts, pavers and rollers, Landoll gives you the ability to load just about anything just inches from the ground.",

This high visibility light package has substantially increased awareness and is standard equipment on all 400 and 800 series trailers.",

Reconnecting is just as easy. Back up and the alignment wedge centers the neck and the \"A\" frame load carrier relocks the lower deck and lifts the trailer to transport position. Choose one of seven ride heights to adjust to the proper transport position.",

            "The Landoll 2400 Series Weatherproofer 1 (WP1) offers a combination of parabolic ripper shanks and tandem disc gangs that provide the most effective primary tillage tool in the market place. The ability to manage the soil, water, and residue all with a single pass is exactly what the industry has been asking for. The 2400 Series Weatherproofer 1 fulfills this need.",
            "Simplicity in Primary Tillage",
            "Primary tillage tools have had to evolve to meet the needs of current production agricultural practices. High yielding crops produce high levels of residue. Primary tillage tools have to be able to manage this residue effectively. The simplicity of the Weatherproofer 1 and the ease of adjustment allows this series to perform up to its expectations every time. Single point depth control sets the disc gangs to cut the residue. The shank working depth is adjusted via two bolts per shank leg. The Weatherproofer 1 Series is truly a \"set it and forget it\" type of tool. This simplicity makes operation of the Weatherproofer 1 very user friendly.",

            "The Landoll Way",
            "Landoll's solid reputation of building quality tillage equipment is built into every 2400 Series Weatherproofer 1. Precision, laser cut frame components embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built-in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings that are cushioned by c-flex mounts are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty. Heavy-duty coil spring auto-reset shanks allow 3,600 lbs. of point load with a 16\" trip height. The self-leveling hitch and the single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability of the Weatherproofer 1 beyond the competition.",

Tandem offset disc gangs located upfront cut, size and blend the residue with auto-reset ripper shanks following to facilitate soil management and compaction control. 24\" shank spacing on all models provides ultimate fracturing of soil profiles to allow water and oxygen to enter into the growth environment. Optional rear leveling devices allow the operator to choose the best match for his expectations and needs."

            "All models in the Brillion Pulverizer line have a common denominator...HIGHER YIELD. Producers know that higher yields start with a properly prepared seedbed and a firm seedbed is critical to maintain a uniform planting depth. The ideal seedbed should be firm with fine particles at the seed depth and should have a layer of loose mulch on the surface to slow evaporation and conserve moisture.",
            "Many of the most valuable nutrients are locked in the clods and root crowns left in the field. The Pulverizer crushes those clods and breaks down the root crowns to release those nutrients for use by the crop. At the same time, air pockets are eliminated and moisture is drawn into the root zone through capillary action. Good seed to soil contact creates more uniform germination, pollination, and maturity...and that means increased yields and greater profits.",

            "The Brillion Pulverizer line is a genuine asset to the value of the soil and can be the missing link in improving the soil from mediocre to a good growth environment with just a single pass. The ribs or ridges on the Pulverizer wheels/rolls are the real workhorses; the residue is anchored into the surface of the seedbed so it can't be blown or washed into road ditches, waterways, culverts, etc. The ribs form a distinct texture on the surface that allows the soil surface to breathe in the event of a crusting rain. The soil will normally split and crack along the rib cuts to allow oxygen and water to enter the soil and to give small seeds a place to grow through. Some producers also utilize the Pulverizer (equipped with notched wheels) in a post-plant mode, further firming the seedbed for optimum germination.",
            "It's About Smooth",
            "The Brillion Pulverizer will put a smooth, textured finish on the seedbed. The smooth seedbed allows for closer to the surface harvest in a soybean field and the ultimate opportunity for high-speed cutting and harvesting of alfalfa. The smooth seedbed also has any small to medium-sized stones pushed into the soil to lessen the occurrence of an ingestion by a combine or forage harvester.",

            "The Shank Leg",

The geometry of the shank leg and the shape of the point combine to lift and lower the soil between the slots and develop a network of horizontal cracks and breaks between the shanks. This slot along with the cracks and breaks created in the growth profile allows water and oxygen to infiltrate the soil to enhance plant growth for the next season. The depth of the slot is determined by how deep and thick the compaction layer is. This process is instrumental in keeping the biological environment favorable for residue decomposition.",

Spring cushion lead coulters with different blade options cut the residue and slice the upper layers in the soil profile ahead of the shanks. Easily adjustable gauge wheels allow for quick, positive depth changes for different conditions. The Zone Commander is available in 3 to 7 shank non-folding models and in 7, 8 and 9 shank folding models.",
            "The Zone Commander is more than just another ripper. The Zone Commander can be an integral part of almost any type of cropping scenario. Even though these machines were initially designed for deep in-line tillage, some customers use the Zone Commander for incorporation practices such as sludge and manure application. Others have utilized the parabolic shank leg option for more disturbance on the soil surface. Still, others have opted for the low disturbance shank legs for the absolute least amount of surface disturbance. From true no-tillers to conventional tillage aficionados, the Zone Commander and its concept of compaction management is a yield enhancement investment.",

            "Isn't it time that excessive residue levels and cold wet spring soils be addressed in your operation? Put the 7400 VT Plus Series from Landoll to work and increase your return on investment with higher yields, a direct result of earlier planting and more uniform emergence.",
            "Perfectly Sizes and Mixes Residue & Soil",
            "A great deal of research went into the design of the 7400 VT Plus Series. Determining the perfect gang angle, disc blade, and spacing was addressed head-on by the engineering staff. The results are the ideal vertical tillage unit that has the ability to anchor residue, work at shallow depths, mix and blend the soil, kill weeds and level ruts from previous operations. The smooth blades stay sharp longer and handle rocks and stones better than ripple or fluted blades.",
            "Spring or Fall? It's Your Choice",
            "Better return on investment is what multi-tasking is all about. The Landoll 7400 VT Plus Series offers you a true multi-tasking tool. The VT can be used in fall, spring, or in both seasons! In fall, the VT allows the decomposition process to begin by mixing just the right amount of soil with the residue. The residue is anchored down to prevent wind and water erosion during the winter months. In spring, the VT prepares the perfect seedbed. Because the VT can perform at precise working depths, it can be set to run no deeper than where the seed will be placed during planting.",
            "Durable and Reliable",
            "The Landoll 7400 VT Plus Series is built in true Landoll style...precision, laser cut frame components that embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built-in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty. Gang angles are fixed at 10 degrees on the front and rear. Disc blades are spaced at 7\" on all gangs on all sizes. The blades are 22\" low concavity; blade thickness is either 6 ga. or  1/4 \". The self-leveling hitch and single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability of the VT Plus beyond the competition. Over-sized tires on walking tandem axles carry the load and allow for precision depth control across the entire width of the machine. Pivoting gauge wheels on the front of the wings contribute to a controlled depth of the wings even at higher speeds.",
            "Sized to Fit",
            "The VT Plus Series is available in sizes from 13' 10\" to 49' 9\". The units up to 33 feet are 3 sections folding while the units from 39' 9\" to 49' 9\" feet are 5 section folding. The 3 section units transport under 17' 11\". The 5 section machines transport at 17' 6\". Transport heights range from 9' 10\" to 13' 11\". Horsepower requirements for the VT Plus Series are 10 HP per foot.",

It is also being used for mowing waterways, clipping pastures, and in some cases, unique topping operations in some specialty crops.

            "The B40i5 is a 4-wheel articulating forklift with dual rear-drive tires and soft-poly front load tires. The hydrostatic drive provides excellent traction and braking, high-speed capability and power to enable climbing steep ramps with loads. Three or four stage masts are available making this unit excellent for loading/unloading trailers, containers and highway trailers. The B40i5 can work inside and outside on paved surfaces and has a floating front axle allowing the truck to ride smoothly over uneven floors. The Bendi B40i5 does all of the jobs of reach and counterbalanced trucks but in much narrower aisles.",

The Bendi B40i5 has large diameter tires and the truck has great under clearance for avoiding floor obstructions. One forklift can go from inside the truck to the rack eliminating staging and additional operators and support forklifts.",

The 845-AG's 45-ton capacity is matched to handle even the heaviest of the field-ready tractors and choppers in production today. The heavy haul requirement was carefully considered during the product development of the 845E-AG resulting in a trailer that comes standard with a Heavy Duty Gooseneck with provisions for a 36\" Flip extension.",
            "Built For the Heavy Haul - Ag, Construction, Forklifts, and More",
            "The 845-AG capacity comes in at 45 tons (90,000 lbs within 16' and 80,000 lbs. within 12') and a 19-1/4\" loaded deck height keeps the center of gravity lower than most detachable trailers. This trailer is built with Heavy Haul aluminum pullouts that are 30% stronger than the 835 pullouts and extend out to 13' wide on 6\" increments. Pulled out to the proper width and planked, these over widths are designed to handle big wheel loader and some tracking equipment. Enlarged lift cylinders with a 150,000 lb. lift capacity and gooseneck flip brackets for 36\" flip overextension round out the heavy haul features on the 845-AG. The heavy haul load carrier allows the driver to match the needed ground clearance in one of the 7-ride height positions to choose from.",
            "Raising the Bar on GVWR",
            "Most 2 axle base trailers run out of GVWR to legally permit many heavier loads. The Landoll 845-AG tops out at 116,500 lbs. / 51,076 KG GVWR allowing for a full 90,000 lbs. of payload. The trailer equipped with the gooseneck extension and the third flip axle will scale even the toughest AG tractors. Now as always each state DOT will control the exact weighs you can transport on their individual highways.",
            "Regen-Hoss Hydraulics",
            "Not only is the 845-AG built for heavy haul Ag, it comes standard with REGEN-HOSS hydraulics, the new hydraulic -regeneration valve system with Rexroth valve rated at 2500 PSI and 20GPM. That is a significant increase in hydraulic speed, decreasing the amount of time it takes to load equipment.",

            "The new 845-AG Hauloll is designed to move today and tomorrow's heaviest equipment. The 845-AG's 45-ton capacity is matched to handle even the heaviest of the field-ready tractors and choppers in production today. The heavy haul requirement was carefully considered during the product development of the 845E-AG resulting in a trailer that comes standard with a Heavy Duty Gooseneck with provisions for a 36\" Flip extension.",
            "Built For the Heavy Haul - Ag, Construction, Forklifts, and More",
            "The 845-AG capacity comes in at 45 tons (90,000 lbs within 16' and 80,000 lbs. within 12') and a 19-1/4\" loaded deck height keeps the center of gravity lower than most detachable trailers. This trailer is built with Heavy Haul aluminum pullouts that are 30% stronger than the 835 pullouts and extend out to 13' wide on 6\" increments. Pulled out to the proper width and planked, these over widths are designed to handle big wheel loader and some tracking equipment. Enlarged lift cylinders with a 150,000 lb. lift capacity and gooseneck flip brackets for 36\" flip overextension round out the heavy haul features on the 845-AG. The heavy haul load carrier allows the driver to match the needed ground clearance in one of the 7-ride height positions to choose from.",
            "Raising the Bar on GVWR",
            "Most 2 axle base trailers run out of GVWR to legally permit many heavier loads. The Landoll 845-AG tops out at 116,500 lbs. / 51,076 KG GVWR allowing for a full 90,000 lbs. of payload. The trailer equipped with the gooseneck extension and the third flip axle will scale even the toughest AG tractors. Now as always each state DOT will control the exact weighs you can transport on their individual highways.",
            "Regen-Hoss Hydraulics",
            "Not only is the 845-AG built for heavy haul Ag, it comes standard with REGEN-HOSS hydraulics, the new hydraulic -regeneration valve system with Rexroth valve rated at 2500 PSI and 20GPM. That is a significant increase in hydraulic speed, decreasing the amount of time it takes to load equipment.",

            "The new 845-AG Hauloll is designed to move today and tomorrow's heaviest equipment. The 845-AG's 45-ton capacity is matched to handle even the heaviest of the field-ready tractors and choppers in production today. The heavy haul requirement was carefully considered during the product development of the 845E-AG resulting in a trailer that comes standard with a Heavy Duty Gooseneck with provisions for a 36\" Flip extension.",
            "Built For the Heavy Haul - Ag, Construction, Forklifts, and More",
            "The 845-AG capacity comes in at 45 tons (90,000 lbs within 16' and 80,000 lbs. within 12') and a 19-1/4\" loaded deck height keeps the center of gravity lower than most detachable trailers. This trailer is built with Heavy Haul aluminum pullouts that are 30% stronger than the 835 pullouts and extend out to 13' wide on 6\" increments. Pulled out to the proper width and planked, these over widths are designed to handle big wheel loader and some tracking equipment. Enlarged lift cylinders with a 150,000 lb. lift capacity and gooseneck flip brackets for 36\" flip overextension round out the heavy haul features on the 845-AG. The heavy haul load carrier allows the driver to match the needed ground clearance in one of the 7-ride height positions to choose from.",
            "Raising the Bar on GVWR",
            "Most 2 axle base trailers run out of GVWR to legally permit many heavier loads. The Landoll 845-AG tops out at 116,500 lbs. / 51,076 KG GVWR allowing for a full 90,000 lbs. of payload. The trailer equipped with the gooseneck extension and the third flip axle will scale even the toughest AG tractors. Now as always each state DOT will control the exact weighs you can transport on their individual highways.",
            "Regen-Hoss Hydraulics",
            "Not only is the 845-AG built for heavy haul Ag, it comes standard with REGEN-HOSS hydraulics, the new hydraulic -regeneration valve system with Rexroth valve rated at 2500 PSI and 20GPM. That is a significant increase in hydraulic speed, decreasing the amount of time it takes to load equipment.",

By running the Speed Blade at a shallow working depth and firmly packing the soil, water will run off the jobsite rather than soak in.

The drum has a capacity of up to 1,000 gallons; the extra weight further enhances the leveling and packing ability. Optional transport lift wheels allow a contractor to cross a road without having to load the unit back on a trailer to get to the other side of a highway.

            "The Brillion Sure Stand Concept has survived the test of time and the challenges from many competitors and many different seeding methods. However, the simplicity of the Sure Stand Concept is still the best way to seed turf and grasses efficiently. The larger front notched roller firms the seedbed and puts shallow indentations into the soil surface. The seed is delivered from the seed boxes to free fall onto the deflectors. The deflectors spread the seed across the full width of the seeder for a broadcast style of seeding. The smaller rear roller, with its notches splitting the middle of the front indentations, squeezes the soil around the seed for ultimate seed to soil contact and consistent seed placement. That's the Sure Stand Concept.",

The LSP5 and LSP6 models are three-point hitch models, while the LSS6 comes standard with both a three-point hitch and a skid loader adaptor plate.

Those are the parameters that the engineering staff had to work with when the Till 'N Seed(r) was designed. The foundation of the Till 'N Seed(r) is the one-piece all-welded steel frame. This frame supports the 3-rotor ground engaging seeding mechanism. This frame also supports the metered seedboxes and the three range transmission. Accurate and consistent seed placement is assured with a 6-foot seeding width.",
            "User-Friendly",
            "Seeding rates are adjusted with \"micro-meter\" settings for each box. Down pressure on the tillage rotor is adjusted with an air shock located on the right side of the machine. Seed depth is set with adjustable gauge wheels on either end of the tillage rotor. The seed is broadcast onto the soil as it is opened up by the rotors. A cast-iron pulverizer roller finishes the seeding operation by firming the seedbed.",
            "Looking Closer",
            "The ground-engaging seeding mechanism is very unique. The star-shaped blades on the stationary front-drive rotor are overlapped by the blades on the air shock controlled tillage rotor. This design makes these two rotors self-cleaning. The chain drive between these two rotors drives the tillage rotor at a 2:1 ratio. The cast iron pulverizer roller is free to float to closely follow the contours of the ground for a complete seeding job. The seedboxes are driven from the chain drive transmission that has three ranges for a wide variety of seeding rates. The front box utilizes the large diameter, large flute meter with an agitator for the larger, bulky seeds. The rear box has the 1\" diameter fluted meters for precise seeding of the very fine, small seeds.",

            "The Till 'N Seed(r) offers a fully adjustable Cat. I-II three-point hitch that can be offset to accommodate tractors with a wide wheel tread. Built-in parking stands allow the Till 'N Seed(r) to be safely detached from the tractor without the fear of tipping. A built-in walk-board with step and handrail on the rear of the unit allows for easy filling of the seedboxes. Built-in tie-down lugs with integral lifting points let the operator safely load and unload the unit as well as securely tie it down without damage to the machine. A built-in calibration tray under the seedbox is available for custom seed rate calibration. The Till 'N Seed(r) has built-in seedbox disconnects to effectively use the lower mechanism as a light tillage device without turning the seed meters. The Till 'N Seed(r) has proven itself as a very effective thatcher/aerator with the seedboxes disengaged.",

            "One of the key features of the 4630-36 Folding Seeder is the ability of the mainframe to allow each of the three seeders to operate completely independently of each other. That equates to the ability to seed 36' wide with the convenience and field hugging features of a 12' machine. The individual, frame-mounted three-point hitches raise and lower the seeders without changing the position of the mainframe. This allows the operator to raise the seeders at the end of the field for effortless turning.",

Rigid models from 10' to 20' and 30', 40' and 50' front folding units fit nearly any size operation. The ability of all of these units to seed into conventionally tilled soil all the way to no-till ground sets the Landoll 5000 Series apart from the competition. The pneumatic down pressure feature on the openers allows user-friendly adjustment to fit whatever conditions are encountered. That is seeding innovation at its finest.",

The key element to this commonality is consistency from a manufacturing standpoint right down to the end-user. If you look closely at the Landoll 5000 Series Drill, there is a clear difference between it and the competition. Laser-cut and robotically welded components add up to better reliability. Heavier gauge steel in the seed boxes and covers means better longevity. The pneumatic down pressure system completely eliminates spring breakage and inconsistent depth control. Maintenance-free pivots in all critical locations mean long life and less downtime.",

From transport to field and from field to transport takes just minutes, all done from the tractor. Seedboxes on these large units can be configured just like the smaller units.",

            "All of the 5000 Series Drills are equipped with monitors including acre meters, seed tube flow sensors, and bin level sensors that keep the operator in touch with all of the vital operations of the drill. These monitors/sensors are factory installed. The entire line of 5000 Series Drills come standard with a hitch-mounted air compressor to allow for making down pressure adjustments in the field. A new and improved fluted meter system has been incorporated into the 5000 Series Drills that is more precise and easier to adjust.

The 2-Bar frame allows for handy maneuvering and easy pulling in the field. The ability of these machines to reach just slightly deeper into the soil profile than the moldboard plow allows producers to manage compaction layers in a very economical way.

            "America's Favorite Vertical Tillage Machine Made Versatile",
            "How can America's favorite vertical tillage machine be made even better? That was a tough challenge for the design engineering department and sales staff, but listening to feedback from 7400 VT Plus customers was critical. Customers were asking for a VT unit that could adapt to changing field environments and could be used in a variety of residue conditions. The result is the all-new 7500 Series VT Plus with Adjustable Gangs.",
            "Big News for the Tillage Industry",
            "The adjustable gang feature allows the operator to change the angle of the disc gangs anywhere between 5 and 15 degrees on the go from the comfort of the tractor cab. Are field conditions changing and your vertical tillage operations need to be less aggressive or more aggressive? Not a problem for the 7500 VT Plus. Just change the gang angle on the fly to adapt to changing conditions. Does more or less residue need to be buried to properly prepare your seedbed? Not a problem for the 7500 VT Plus. One machine can handle varying types of residue and create the field finish you desire from your vertical tillage unit.",
            "Still Has All the Features for Perfectly Sizing and Mixing Residue and Soil",
            "The 7500 Series VT Plus with Adjustable Gangs still has the same proven features as its predecessor. The 24\" smooth blades stay sharper longer and handle rocks and stones better than the ripple or fluted blades offered by competitive brands. In wet, sticky conditions, the smooth surface sheds residue better and is easily kept clean by heavy-duty scrapers.",
            "The 7500 VT Plus is carried by walking tandem wheels and high flotation tires for outstanding ground following capabilities. The wider tires leave a minimal impression in the soil, allowing the unit to be run at shallower depths. The folding models fold to a narrow transport width and the weight of the machine is equally distributed on the transport tires.",
            "User Friendly and Built to Last",
            "Every disc gang is equipped with C-flex hangers that provide cushion protection against rocks and other obstructions. The scraper bar is mounted to the C-flex hangers allowing scrapers and disc blades to move simultaneously with each other. The self-aligning feature of each trunnion bearing allows bearing realignment as the hangers flex and move. Bearings are triple-lip sealed and cannot be over-greased and are covered by Landoll's three-year limited warranty policy.",
            "The rock shaft is protected by UHMW polymer which eliminates wear and maintenance requirements. Hinge joints are equipped with hardened pins that rotate on maintenance-free polymer bushings for improved machine performance and extended life of the hinge.",
            "Adjustments are user-friendly; hydraulically controlled fore to aft leveling can be adjusted on the go. Wing frame leveling is also simple and all adjustment wrenches are stored on the frame. And the innovative ease of adjusting the gang angle on the go from the tractor makes the 7500 VT Plus a user-friendly, simple but versatile vertical tillage unit built tough to perform for years to come. That's the Landoll way!",

            "The Evolution of Tillage",
            "Today's tillage is geared toward handling heavier residue, providing better efficiency, and trimming input costs along the way. The 7800 Series High Speed Landoll (HSL) is the latest entry in the high-speed disc market from Landoll, a proven leader in the tillage industry since 1963.",
            "Available in working widths from 13 to 40 feet, the HSL can cut, size and bury residue, is robust and reliable to work through rocky conditions and leave a finished seedbed that is level and smooth.",
            "Smoothest Ride in the Industry",
            "The HSL offers the smoothest ride in the industry with its industry-first tilt control feature, high floatation tires, walking tandems on the wings of the three-section folding units, and spring cushions on the rear leveling attachment.",
            "The tilt control feature simplifies the adjustment process when leveling the unit from front to rear. The tilt control feature also aids operator ease in cab tracking adjustments; keeping the HSL running straight allows the discs to work most efficiently. Working with shallow depths of 2\" to 5\" at high speeds demands a smooth ride and there is nothing better than heavy-duty flotation tires and walking tandems on the wings. Rear leveling attachments are spring cushioned eliminating any bounce at the rear of the machine. A simple cylinder adjustment allows the operator to adjust the down pressure on the reels or rollers to meet varying field conditions.",
            "The HSL is Reliable",
            "Individual torsion mounted 24\" notched or smooth blades on a 17-degree angle and 10\" spacing are protected by rubber mounts to relieve stress on the frame and blades. Maintenance-free, dual tapered roller bearings are located on the back side of each disc blade and are protected by an internally rotating 5-lip seal.",
            "The HSL utilizes a floating hitch design to follow irregular ground contours and maintain an even cutting depth, which is assisted by the hydraulic wing down pressure. The hydraulic jack makes hooking and unhooking the unit safe and convenient.",
            "Simple as 1-2-3",
            "All front mounted depth controls are easy to access and getting the HSL field ready is simple with 3 easy steps: First, set the cutting depth of the discs with the tires up front. Second, level the unit from front to rear using the tilt control feature. Third, set the pressure of the rear leveling attachment. That's it and you are on your way.",
            "Customize Your HSL",
            "Each HSL can be customized to specific soil conditions with the addition of Chevron Rollers, Spring Tine Reels or Rubber Rollers.",
            "Heavy-duty chevron conditioner reels put a finishing touch to every pass. The reel firms up the soil profile, breaks up clods and creates an excellent seedbed while anchoring residue in primary tillage applications. The chevron reel is best in arid climates with drier soil conditions.",
            "The spring tine reels level and firm the seedbed. The vibration of the steel spring tines helps shed sticky soils and flex when hitting stones. The spring tine reels leave a corduroy finish on the soil surface.",
            "The rubber rollers provide a more complete firming action for widely varying soil types. The rollers will push stones down into the soil for smoother planting and harvesting operations. The Farm Flex rubber along with adjustable scrapers keep sticky soils from building up on the rollers. The rubber rollers are the best rear attachment for rocky conditions and varying soil types.",
            "High Speed Residue Management",
            "The HSL from Landoll is the ideal aggressive high-speed tillage tool that's changing the way you manage residue. Able to cover hundreds of acres a day, the HSL is ideal for both primary or secondary tillage operations and fall or spring applications. And have peace of mind that your high-speed disc is tough and rugged and built to last - that's the Landoll way!",

            "The SL120 is a 4-Wheel SwingMast(r) VNA and Side Loading Forklift with independently driven front wheels and dual rear steer tires. The front mast rotates 90deg and has a side shift of 44\" (1118mm), allowing stacking easily in Very Narrow Aisles. The SL120 can also work inside and outside on paved surfaces, can perform the jobs of a high capacity front loading and side loading forklift combined including working in bulk storage, cantilever rack and climbing steep ramps. The SL120 performs the jobs of a high capacity counterbalanced truck but in aisles over 40% smaller. The ability to store and transport heavy long loads as a side loader increases versatility and maximizes utilization.",

            "The versatile SL120 forklift replaces conventional counterbalanced fork trucks in the standard warehouse and manufacturing heavy pallet and long-load handling operations. The unique design allows operators to use it as a counterbalance truck indoors or out, operate in very narrow aisles in the warehouse, and replace the counterbalanced trucks that require much wider aisles. The operator's compartment is offset providing a wide long load carrying side deck so the SL120 can also be used as a side loader. The front tires are 22'' (559mm) dia. and the rear steer tires are 16.25\" (413mm) dia. providing great under clearance for avoiding floor obstructions. The rear steer axle is articulated to provide a smooth ride over rough floor conditions.",

However, deep tillage machines with depth capacities well below the normal operating depths need to be especially tough. In many instances, these tools will be operating in profiles that have never been touched by a tillage tool before. The 2500 Series In-Row Ripper has what it takes.",

            "Built with 6\" x 6\" and 6'' x 4'' structural steel tubing, the robotically welded frame is the foundation for the heavy-duty Cat. II, III or IV three-point hitch. The robust frame is the anchor for the lead coulters that start the tillage process. The rear bar of the frame supports the 2500's shank assemblies.",

The auto-reset spring shank assemblies allow for 2,300 lbs. of point load and 16\" of trip height. New to the line-up is the heavy-duty hydraulic auto-reset shank assemblies that offer a massive 4,000 lbs. of point load and 28'' trip height. This is the most rugged shank offered and can handle heavy clay soils with ease and offers protection in rocky conditions. Rigid-shear bolt models are also available for areas with minimal soil obstructions.",
            "The Shank Leg",
            "The heart and soul of 2500 is the shank leg, which cuts a narrow slot into the soil profile. The geometry of the shank leg and the shape of the point combine to lift and lower the soil between the slots and develop a network of horizontal cracks and breaks between the shanks. This slot along with the cracks and breaks created in the growth profile allows water and oxygen to infiltrate the soil to enhance plant growth for the next season. The depth of the slot is determined by how deep and thick the compaction layer is. This process is instrumental in keeping the biological environment favorable for residue decomposition.",

Spring cushion lead coulters with different blade options cut the residue and slice the upper layers in the soil profile ahead of the shanks. Turnbuckle-style adjustable gauge wheels allow for quick, positive depth changes for different conditions. 2500 is available in 3 to 7 shank non-folding models and in 7 to 16 shank folding models. The larger folding models include a heavy-duty pull hitch caddy.",
            "2500 is more than just another ripper. The 2500 Series In-Row Ripper can be an integral part of almost any type of cropping scenario. Even though these machines were initially designed for deep in-line tillage, some customers use 2500 for incorporation practices such as sludge and manure application. Others have utilized the parabolic shank leg option for more disturbance on the soil surface. Still, others have opted for the low disturbance shank legs for the absolute least amount of surface disturbance. From true no-tillers to conventional tillage aficionados, the 2500 and its concept of compaction management is a yield enhancement investment.",

Conditions change from planting to planting and the tools used to plant them need to versatile enough to accommodate. The Brillion Food Plot Seeder can prep and plant in one pass in some conditions. However, in most situations, some preparation needs to be done to ensure a proper planting process. The Brillion Food Plot Seeder can be adjusted to be used as a disc harrow by shortening the top link on the hitch to put the seeder full forward so just the disc harrow contacts the soil. This will allow for rugged tillage for a first or second pass. By lengthening the top link on the hitch, the cultivator segment and roller can be used as a complete preparation tillage tool. If the final seedbed is loose and fluffy, raise the three-point arms slightly, lengthen the top link some more to put the weight of the entire seeder on the pulverizer roller and roll the field to firm up the seedbed before planting. Once the seedbed is firm, level the seeder on the hitch, engage the seedboxes, and proceed with the seeding operation. In some cases, the seeded plot may need to be rolled again after seeding to ensure the best seed to soil contact. Many of these scenarios may or may not be present in every situation. Whatever conditions you run into in your food plots, be assured the Brillion Food Plot Seeder can handle it!",

The 440 and 455 \"B\" Series Traveling Axle trailers are the first models with these added standard features.",
            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "The Landoll 440B is a tandem axle trailer with a capacity of up to 40 tons. It is available in 41', 48', 53', and California legal 50' lengths. Handle tough equipment including super low clearance pavers with an easy one-man operation.",

            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",

The 440 and 455 \"B\" Series Traveling Axle trailers are the first models with these added standard features.",
            "H.O.S.S. cuts the overall operational time in half. The axle traveling forward has increased by 36% and moving back by 58%. Tilt deck positioning has increased to nearly 63%, while winch in and out speeds are closer to 66%. This improvement will allow for more loads to take place.",
            "The Landoll 440B is a tandem axle trailer with a capacity of up to 40 tons. It is available in 41', 48', 53', and California legal 50' lengths. Handle tough equipment including super low clearance pavers with an easy one-man operation.",

            "Ultimate Stability",
            "The four beam frame design is the backbone of a super versatile, solid piece of equipment. Wider main beams with a wider undercarriage, outboard tilt cylinder mounts, outer beam pivot points add superior stability while loading heavy loads.",

            "Landoll is the only trailer manufacturer to offer powder coat paint on an entire trailer frame. The very durable finish provides excellent chemical and salt resistance while giving Landoll trailers a high quality, attractive appearance. A zinc-rich powder primer is applied prior to painting the entire frame with one of eight standard powder coat colors.",

            "The Brillion Sure Stand Concept has survived the test of time and the challenges from many competitors and many different seeding methods. However, the simplicity of the Sure Stand Concept is still the best way to seed legumes and grasses efficiently. The larger front notched roller firms the seedbed and put shallow indentations into the soil surface. The seed is metered from the seedboxes to free fall onto the deflectors. The deflectors spread the seed across the full width of the seeder for a broadcast style of seeding. The smaller rear roller, with its notches splitting the middle of the front indentations, squeezes the soil around the seed for the ultimate in seed to soil contact and consistent seed placement. That's the Sure Stand Concept.",

            "New to the seeder line-up is the 16' Agricultural Seeder, which takes the popular Sure Stand Seeder concept to the next level. The 16' seeding width and 20-bushel capacity seedbox allow the operator to spend more time seeding and less time stopping to fill the seedboxes, maximizing efficiency.",
            "The seeder is equipped with the proven Micro-Meter seed metering system and can seed a variety of seeds at the correct depth to ensure optimal germination. The 16' Seeder features pneumatic down pressure on the rear roller for better seed coverage and squeezing out more air pockets in the seedbed. The heavy-duty frame to support the larger seedboxes delivers more weight per foot on the rollers. Any soil clods are easily crushed, further fine-tuning the seedbed for excellent germination rates.",

Equipped with a meter and agitator box as standard equipment, these three-point hitch models will do everything the larger machines can do, only on a much smaller scale. Coil tine wheel track removers and blade agitators in the rear seedbox are standard. The close-coupled hitch on these models allows use with compact tractors for excellent maneuverability in close quarters. These units may be small in size, but they are big on features.",

In many cases, the savings in seed alone will pay for a Sure Stand Seeder in just a short time. Don't risk your crop to another system. Don't settle for less.

At home in high residue primary tillage applications as well as in secondary operations preparing a seedbed for planting, the 6200 Series from Landoll is the disc of choice. Features like the high ratio of weight per foot for penetration and cutting in the fall, as well as overlapping staggered gangs for exceptional leveling in the spring provide for use over two seasons. User-friendly adjustments allow the operator to fine-tune the 6200 Series to meet the needs of the season.",

            "The 6200 Series Tandem Disc Harrow is built in true Landoll style...precision, laser cut frame components that embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built-in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty.",

Blade diameters are 22\", 24\", 26\" or 28\" (model specific) to match the needs of the most discriminate customer. The self-leveling hitch and the single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability beyond the competition. Over-sized tires on walking tandem axles carry the load and allow for precision depth control across the entire width of the harrow. Pivoting gauge wheels on the front of the wings contribute to a controlled depth of the wings even at higher speeds.",

Reducing field trips will save fuel, operator labor, and equipment dollars. Combining field trips also conserves moisture and provides a firmer seedbed.

The Tilloll offers spring cushion shanks with 10\" sweeps; under frame clearance is 25 1/2\". There is an incorporating reel behind the shanks to mix and blend the soil with the finer particles in the seedbed zone while incorporating chemicals.

            "The Landoll 2211 Series Ripoll has versatility engrained in its DNA. The ability to utilize either chisel shanks or ripper shanks truly provides the best of most tillage operations in one solid performer. Built-in adjustability allows the operator to fine tune the 2211 to fit a wide variety of conditions and expectations. Built on a massive structural steel frame, the 2211 has the backbone to allow for a unique staggered shank arrangement and overlapping front disc gangs. Adding in the adjustable gang angle for both the front and rear gangs allow the 24\" disc blades to use their 10 1/2\" spacing to the fullest for exceptional residue flow. Chisel shanks with straight or twisted points allow for maximum mixing and blending of the sized residue. Equipping the 2211 with ripper shanks and v-cap or shark-fin points allow for compaction management while incorporating the residue into the soil. Specifically equipped, the Landoll 2211 Ripoll is a true hybrid!",
            "Soil Management",
            "Producer expectations determine how the Landoll 2211 Ripoll will be set. The 2211 incorporates both front and rear adjustable disc gangs. The front gangs are responsible for initial sizing of the residue. The rear gangs handle the degree of levelness and final blending and mixing of the residue. The shanks (either chisel or ripper) are the workhorses of this machine. Whether working shallow with the chisels to capture the best mixing or working deeper to manage compaction, the 2211 is the machine to use. Soil management practices can be ever changing. The Landoll 2211 Ripoll is designed from the ground up to be able to meet many different expectations.",
            "Durable and Reliable",
            "The 2211 Ripoll is built in true Landoll style...precision, laser cut frame components embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty. Heavy-duty coil spring auto-reset shanks allow 1,750 lbs. of point load and 32\" of under frame clearance. The reset is the same for either the chisel or the ripper shank legs. The self-leveling hitch and single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability of the Landoll 2211 Ripoll beyond the competition.",

            "Long ago Brillion accepted the challenge of providing clod-free seedbeds by developing the Pulvi-Mulcher, a one pass secondary tillage tool. Those pioneering efforts produced a machine with a combination of roller wheels and spring teeth to crush, harrow and condition the soil to provide ideal planting environments for producing bigger yields.",
            "Over the years, Brillion Farm Equipment has dominated this market. Heavy-duty Pulverizer roller assemblies that can handle the challenges of secondary tillage set the stage as the leader. Strong, yet flexible frame members allow the Pulvi-Mulcher to follow the contour of the soil for consistent performance. A selection of Pulverizer wheel types and cultivator's teeth satisfies the needs of different soil types and conditions. This combination adds up to the industry-leading Brillion Pulvi-Mulcher that meets the challenge of the soil and competition.",
            "The Heavy-Weight in Pulvi-Mulchers",
            "The 3600 Series Pulvi-Mulcher, the latest addition to the model line-up, features wider working widths, increased trash clearance and reduced downtime in the field. The series is available in 21', 25', 30' and 36'6\" working widths. The 30' model weighs 80% more than the popular WL360 model for more clod crushing power. The 36'6\" unit is the widest Pulvi-Mulcher ever offered by Brillion.",
            "All 3600 Series models feature 8\" roller axles with heavy-duty bearings that improve reliability and reduce maintenance interruptions in the field. The design includes three rows of two-piece edge bent s-tines on overall 6\" spacing. 25\" of under frame shank clearance improves trash flow through the machine. A leveling device in front of the rear roller helps level ridges left by the shanks.",
            "A choice of 20\" Notched, 20\" Crowfoot or 20\" Optimizer Ductile Iron Pulverizer wheels allow each 3600 Series Pulvi-Mulcher to be customized to varying soil conditions. And new to this series is the 24\" Notched Ductile Iron wheel to provide even more clod crushing power with its heavyweight.",
            "Sized for Any Size Operation",
            "Brillion's Pulvi-Mulcher line also includes three other well-known series besides the 3600 Series heavy-weights. The WL Series, available in sizes from 21'8\" to 30', features 4\" roller axles, a choice of 20\" Notched or Crowfoot Ductile Iron Wheels and two rows of either conventional 'C' tines or 'S' tines. These models are flat-folding for a narrow transport width and manageable height.",
            "The ML Series revolutionized the Pulvi-Mulcher industry when it was first introduced. Easier pulling 20\" Ductile Iron rollers and a high clearance frame brought new life to the Pulvi-Mulcher. The long frame members allow more room for residue to flow through the machine. The ML Series is available in sizes from 12'6\" to 18'9\" and fits the needs of mid-sized operations by offering all of the benefits of a full-featured machine without the investment of the larger wing fold models.",
            "The M Series, available in sizes from 7'4\" to 10'4\", rounds out the Brillion Pulvi-Mulcher line-up. These models utilize the rugged and reliable features of the original Pulvi-Mulcher. Sized and priced to fit operations with lower horsepower tractors and other niche markets, the M Series offers the solution to many seedbed preparation issues.",
            "No matter the size of your operation or available horsepower, there's a Brillion Pulvi-Mulcher sized perfectly for your needs!",
