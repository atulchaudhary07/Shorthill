This trailer is built with Heavy Haul aluminum pullouts that are 30% stronger than the 835 pullouts and extend out to 13' wide on 6\" increments. Pulled out to the proper width and planked, these over widths are designed to handle big wheel loader and some tracking equipment. Enlarged lift cylinders with a 150,000 lb. lift capacity and gooseneck flip brackets for 36\" flip overextension round out the heavy haul features on the 845-AG.
