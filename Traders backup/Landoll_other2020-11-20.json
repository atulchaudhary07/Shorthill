      "The Brillion Sure Stand Concept has survived the test of time and the challenges from many competitors and many different seeding methods. However, the simplicity of the Sure Stand Concept is still the best way to seed turf and grasses efficiently. The larger front notched roller firms the seedbed and puts shallow indentations into the soil surface. The seed is delivered from the seed boxes to free fall onto the deflectors. The deflectors spread the seed across the full width of the seeder for a broadcast style of seeding. The smaller rear roller, with its notches splitting the middle of the front indentations, squeezes the soil around the seed for ultimate seed to soil contact and consistent seed placement. That's the Sure Stand Concept.",

      "It's About Higher Yield",
      "All models in the Brillion Pulverizer line have a common denominator...HIGHER YIELD. Producers know that higher yields start with a properly prepared seedbed and a firm seedbed is critical to maintain a uniform planting depth. The ideal seedbed should be firm with fine particles at the seed depth and should have a layer of loose mulch on the surface to slow evaporation and conserve moisture.",
      "Many of the most valuable nutrients are locked in the clods and root crowns left in the field. The Pulverizer crushes those clods and breaks down the root crowns to release those nutrients for use by the crop. At the same time, air pockets are eliminated and moisture is drawn into the root zone through capillary action. Good seed to soil contact creates more uniform germination, pollination, and maturity...and that means increased yields and greater profits.",
      "It's About the Soil",
      "The Brillion Pulverizer line is a genuine asset to the value of the soil and can be the missing link in improving the soil from mediocre to a good growth environment with just a single pass. The ribs or ridges on the Pulverizer wheels/rolls are the real workhorses; the residue is anchored into the surface of the seedbed so it can't be blown or washed into road ditches, waterways, culverts, etc. The ribs form a distinct texture on the surface that allows the soil surface to breathe in the event of a crusting rain. The soil will normally split and crack along the rib cuts to allow oxygen and water to enter the soil and to give small seeds a place to grow through. Some producers also utilize the Pulverizer (equipped with notched wheels) in a post-plant mode, further firming the seedbed for optimum germination.",
      "It's About Smooth",
      "The Brillion Pulverizer will put a smooth, textured finish on the seedbed. The smooth seedbed allows for closer to the surface harvest in a soybean field and the ultimate opportunity for high-speed cutting and harvesting of alfalfa. The smooth seedbed also has any small to medium-sized stones pushed into the soil to lessen the occurrence of an ingestion by a combine or forage harvester.",

      "There are numerous entries in the overseeding market. However, many of these entries fall short for customers who are searching for a complete package. Those are the parameters that the engineering staff had to work with when the Till 'N Seed(r) was designed. The foundation of the Till 'N Seed(r) is the one-piece all-welded steel frame. This frame supports the 3-rotor ground engaging seeding mechanism. This frame also supports the metered seedboxes and the three range transmission. Accurate and consistent seed placement is assured with a 6-foot seeding width.",
      "User-Friendly",
      "Seeding rates are adjusted with \"micro-meter\" settings for each box. Down pressure on the tillage rotor is adjusted with an air shock located on the right side of the machine. Seed depth is set with adjustable gauge wheels on either end of the tillage rotor. The seed is broadcast onto the soil as it is opened up by the rotors. A cast-iron pulverizer roller finishes the seeding operation by firming the seedbed.",
      "Looking Closer",
      "The ground-engaging seeding mechanism is very unique. The star-shaped blades on the stationary front-drive rotor are overlapped by the blades on the air shock controlled tillage rotor. This design makes these two rotors self-cleaning. The chain drive between these two rotors drives the tillage rotor at a 2:1 ratio. The cast iron pulverizer roller is free to float to closely follow the contours of the ground for a complete seeding job. The seedboxes are driven from the chain drive transmission that has three ranges for a wide variety of seeding rates. The front box utilizes the large diameter, large flute meter with an agitator for the larger, bulky seeds. The rear box has the 1\" diameter fluted meters for precise seeding of the very fine, small seeds.",
      "Built-In Extras",
      "The Till 'N Seed(r) offers a fully adjustable Cat. I-II three-point hitch that can be offset to accommodate tractors with a wide wheel tread. Built-in parking stands allow the Till 'N Seed(r) to be safely detached from the tractor without the fear of tipping. A built-in walk-board with step and handrail on the rear of the unit allows for easy filling of the seedboxes. Built-in tie-down lugs with integral lifting points let the operator safely load and unload the unit as well as securely tie it down without damage to the machine. A built-in calibration tray under the seedbox is available for custom seed rate calibration. The Till 'N Seed(r) has built-in seedbox disconnects to effectively use the lower mechanism as a light tillage device without turning the seed meters. The Till 'N Seed(r) has proven itself as a very effective thatcher/aerator with the seedboxes disengaged.",

The front Pulverizer roller breaks down the clods and lumps. The cultivator teeth in the middle bring moist soil into the growth zone. The rear Pulverizer roller levels and firms the seedbed. Over the years, these machines have been labeled with many names: Pulvi-Mulcher, Roller Harrow, Culti-Mulcher, and Roller Mulcher to name a few. The name doesn't matter...the concept is the same.",

      "Industry Leader",
      "Long ago Brillion accepted the challenge of providing clod-free seedbeds by developing the Pulvi-Mulcher, a one pass secondary tillage tool. Those pioneering efforts produced a machine with a combination of roller wheels and spring teeth to crush, harrow and condition the soil to provide ideal planting environments for producing bigger yields.",
      "Over the years, Brillion Farm Equipment has dominated this market. Heavy-duty Pulverizer roller assemblies that can handle the challenges of secondary tillage set the stage as the leader. Strong, yet flexible frame members allow the Pulvi-Mulcher to follow the contour of the soil for consistent performance. A selection of Pulverizer wheel types and cultivator's teeth satisfies the needs of different soil types and conditions. This combination adds up to the industry-leading Brillion Pulvi-Mulcher that meets the challenge of the soil and competition.",
      "The Heavy-Weight in Pulvi-Mulchers",
      "The 3600 Series Pulvi-Mulcher, the latest addition to the model line-up, features wider working widths, increased trash clearance and reduced downtime in the field. The series is available in 21', 25', 30' and 36'6\" working widths. The 30' model weighs 80% more than the popular WL360 model for more clod crushing power. The 36'6\" unit is the widest Pulvi-Mulcher ever offered by Brillion.",
      "All 3600 Series models feature 8\" roller axles with heavy-duty bearings that improve reliability and reduce maintenance interruptions in the field. The design includes three rows of two-piece edge bent s-tines on overall 6\" spacing. 25\" of under frame shank clearance improves trash flow through the machine. A leveling device in front of the rear roller helps level ridges left by the shanks.",
      "A choice of 20\" Notched, 20\" Crowfoot or 20\" Optimizer Ductile Iron Pulverizer wheels allow each 3600 Series Pulvi-Mulcher to be customized to varying soil conditions. And new to this series is the 24\" Notched Ductile Iron wheel to provide even more clod crushing power with its heavyweight.",
      "Sized for Any Size Operation",
      "Brillion's Pulvi-Mulcher line also includes three other well-known series besides the 3600 Series heavy-weights. The WL Series, available in sizes from 21'8\" to 30', features 4\" roller axles, a choice of 20\" Notched or Crowfoot Ductile Iron Wheels and two rows of either conventional 'C' tines or 'S' tines. These models are flat-folding for a narrow transport width and manageable height.",
      "The ML Series revolutionized the Pulvi-Mulcher industry when it was first introduced. Easier pulling 20\" Ductile Iron rollers and a high clearance frame brought new life to the Pulvi-Mulcher. The long frame members allow more room for residue to flow through the machine. The ML Series is available in sizes from 12'6\" to 18'9\" and fits the needs of mid-sized operations by offering all of the benefits of a full-featured machine without the investment of the larger wing fold models.",
      "The M Series, available in sizes from 7'4\" to 10'4\", rounds out the Brillion Pulvi-Mulcher line-up. These models utilize the rugged and reliable features of the original Pulvi-Mulcher. Sized and priced to fit operations with lower horsepower tractors and other niche markets, the M Series offers the solution to many seedbed preparation issues.",

A firm, level seedbed allows for better seed to soil contact, which results in faster germination and uniform emergence. Proper seedbed preparation helps warm up the soil for earlier planting and a longer growing season. For maximum efficiency and versatility, the new 8530 is engineered to pull easy, maintain a uniform working depth, and allow for smooth and even residue flow in the toughest of field conditions.",
      "New Features",
      "The 8500 Finisholl hydraulically folds for narrow transport widths and manageable transport heights and provides outstanding out-of-ground clearance. Moving from field to field is made easy! The self-leveling hitch maintains the adjusted front-to-rear frame setting at any operating depth and directs positive weight onto the tractor drawbar regardless of the finishing attachment that is chosen. The user-friendly single point depth control simplifies setting the operating depth and provides precise depth control for the ultimate in finish operations.",
      "Upfront, 22\" smooth ultra-low concavity disc blades are spaced at 7  1/2 \" with an 8-degree gang angle. The smooth cutting edge of this blade has proven to wear sharper and penetrate better than fluted or wavy blades. In wet, sticky conditions, the smooth surface sheds residue better.",
      "A \"split the middle\" shank pattern is used for shank placement allowing for 8\" spacing with 9\" sweeps. Two styles of shanks are offered: s-tine shanks or spring clamp shanks. The two-piece s-tine shanks are geared for rock-free soils, feature 190 lb. point load and will accommodate any sweep with a 47-degree stem angle. The spring clamp shanks feature 190 lb. point load, 10\" trip height, and a three-year warranty.",

      "Need to control field water drainage or reshape waterways? Look no further than a Power Ditcher from Landoll. The PTO driven design can throw dirt, and it can throw dirt far - as far as 25'. Material that is removed is spread evenly and will not disturb an emerging crop.",
      "Durable and Dependable",
      "The Landoll Power Ditcher is one rugged tool that will last for years to come. Shielding on the rotor allows the operator to choose where the dirt will land. The PTO drives the rotor through a chain dropbox. The rotor is adjusted by a skid shoe which determines how much material is removed in each pass.",
      "Endless Potential",
      "The Landoll Power Ditcher provides an entry into a niche market that has a wide variety of potential customers. Production agricultural customers utilize the Power Ditcher any time surface drainage issues come up. Specialty croppers can make use of the Power Ditcher when drainage needs to be addressed. Irrigation customers use the Power Ditcher when surface water needs to be moved from one spot to another. Landscapers and contractors can also make use of a Landoll Power Ditcher. The potential uses are endless!",
      "Models To Choose",
      "The D4P, D5P, and D10P models are differentiated by PTO input, either 540 or 1000 RPM and rotor diameter. All models have shear bolt protected drive lines to protect against foreign objects in the path of the rotor. All models offer replaceable rotor cutters. The D4P is designed for a Cat. I - II three-point hitch while the D5P and D10P are set up for a Cat. II - III three-point hitch. PTO coupler sizes are 1 3/8\" on the three smaller models and 1 3/4\" on the larger D10PH18A model. All models are built with the quality you can only expect from Landoll. Ditches and waterways are made easier with the Landoll Power Ditcher!",

      "Updated Design but Proven Concept",
      "The coulter chisel concept has been used for decades as an alternative primary tillage practice. The newly redesigned Landoll 2100 Series Coulter Chisel incorporates this concept into high capacity. This translates to handling heavy residue at higher speeds with maximum efficiency. Cover more acres per hour using less horsepower per foot than conventional disc rippers.",
      "Available in sizes with 9 to 25 shanks allowing for cutting widths of 11'3\" to 31'3\", these models will work with a wide range of tractor sizes and provide ultimate productivity for nearly any operation. Residue is sized every 7  1/2 \" with the front 22\" cutting coulters. Compaction is eliminated and residue is blended in with the heavy-duty shanks spaced at 15\". Shanks are mounted on staggered bars allowing residue to easily flow through the machine. In addition, shanks are arranged to follow a coulter and have one in between each for optimum residue sizing.",
      "The high-clearance shanks offer 32\" of underframe clearance and are available in auto-reset or rigid shear bolt configurations. The auto-reset shank assemblies provide 1,750 pounds of point load, a 14\" trip height, and the point angle can be adjusted to 50 or 60 degrees. Twisted shovels or straight points are offered to complete the shank assemblies.",
      "User Friendly Features",
      "The 2100 Series Coulter Chisel offers single point depth control at the front of the machine. Hydraulically controlled coulters allow for \"on the go\" adjustments to meet changing conditions right from the comfort of the tractor cab. The self-leveling hitch provides a \"set it and forget it\" adjustment that maintains level operation from front to rear. The updated design features fewer moving parts to help reduce downtime in the field and adjustments are simple to make, further increasing efficiency.",
      "The newly redesigned 2100 Series now accommodates a combo tine and chopper leveling attachment. The combo attachment features three rows of hard surfaced laser stitched coil tine teeth placed on 4\" overall centers. The 5 bladed 16\" diameter chopper reel is spring cushioned and can be hydraulically raised out of the ground in wet and sticky conditions. The choppers are staggered for full overlap of the entire cutting width. This is the ultimate attachment for leveling and clod breaking capabilities leaving a smooth field finish.",
      "Reap Big Benefits",
      "Today's high yielding crops produce large amounts of heavy residue that must be sized and mixed in the soil to accelerate breakdown. The Landoll Coulter Chisel will perform the ultimate primary tillage pass, setting you up for increased yields the following season. Combine this with Landoll's state of the art manufacturing processes to have peace of mind that your 2100 Series Coulter Chisel will be in it for the long haul.",

      "Isn't it time that excessive residue levels and cold wet spring soils be addressed in your operation? Put the 7400 VT Plus Series from Landoll to work and increase your return on investment with higher yields, a direct result of earlier planting and more uniform emergence.",
      "Perfectly Sizes and Mixes Residue & Soil",
      "A great deal of research went into the design of the 7400 VT Plus Series. Determining the perfect gang angle, disc blade, and spacing was addressed head-on by the engineering staff. The results are the ideal vertical tillage unit that has the ability to anchor residue, work at shallow depths, mix and blend the soil, kill weeds and level ruts from previous operations. The smooth blades stay sharp longer and handle rocks and stones better than ripple or fluted blades.",
      "Spring or Fall? It's Your Choice",
      "Better return on investment is what multi-tasking is all about. The Landoll 7400 VT Plus Series offers you a true multi-tasking tool. The VT can be used in fall, spring, or in both seasons! In fall, the VT allows the decomposition process to begin by mixing just the right amount of soil with the residue. The residue is anchored down to prevent wind and water erosion during the winter months. In spring, the VT prepares the perfect seedbed. Because the VT can perform at precise working depths, it can be set to run no deeper than where the seed will be placed during planting.",
      "Durable and Reliable",
      "The Landoll 7400 VT Plus Series is built in true Landoll style...precision, laser cut frame components that embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built-in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty. Gang angles are fixed at 10 degrees on the front and rear. Disc blades are spaced at 7\" on all gangs on all sizes. The blades are 22\" low concavity; blade thickness is either 6 ga. or  1/4 \". The self-leveling hitch and single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability of the VT Plus beyond the competition. Over-sized tires on walking tandem axles carry the load and allow for precision depth control across the entire width of the machine. Pivoting gauge wheels on the front of the wings contribute to a controlled depth of the wings even at higher speeds.",
      "Sized to Fit",
      "The VT Plus Series is available in sizes from 13' 10\" to 49' 9\". The units up to 33 feet are 3 sections folding while the units from 39' 9\" to 49' 9\" feet are 5 section folding. The 3 section units transport under 17' 11\". The 5 section machines transport at 17' 6\". Transport heights range from 9' 10\" to 13' 11\". Horsepower requirements for the VT Plus Series are 10 HP per foot.",

      "Why It Works",
      "Basic straight cut coulters on a weighted gang in the front of the unit cut and size the residue. The chisel shanks, spaced on 15\" centers and equipped with twisted chisel points, engage the soil and mix and blend the sized residue into an acceptable medium for preventing erosion and conserving moisture. These tools will leave the surface ridged to allow more surface to be available to the sunlight for the better dry down and warm up before the next planting season.",
      "Brillion CD Models",
      "The CD models are the original Soil Builders. A single, manually adjustable gang of coulters with 7  1/2 \" spacing in the front of the machine starts the tillage process. Two ranks of chisel shanks are supported on a weighted frame that allows for 15\" shank spacing. The shank and coulter spacing allow one coulter to lead each shank and have one coulter in between each shank for optimum soil breakout and residue flow. The CD series is available in 5 and 7 shank models. These machines fit very well with 100 to 150 HP tractors in most conditions.",
      "Brillion HSB Models",
      "The HSB series is the next generation of Soil Builders. Many of the proven components and features from the CD series have been incorporated into the HSB models. The coulter gangs have remained unchanged other than they are hydraulically controlled. The chisel shanks are mounted to a 3-rank frame for added residue capacity. The lift axle is controlled with a single depth stop cylinder. Walking tandems are available on the larger units. The hitch is longer to accommodate larger tractors with dual tires. The HSB models are available in 7, 9, 11, and 13 shank models. Horsepower requirements are 15 to 20 HP per shank.",
      "Bottom Line",

      "The Landoll 2211 Series Ripoll has versatility engrained in its DNA. The ability to utilize either chisel shanks or ripper shanks truly provides the best of most tillage operations in one solid performer. Built-in adjustability allows the operator to fine tune the 2211 to fit a wide variety of conditions and expectations. Built on a massive structural steel frame, the 2211 has the backbone to allow for a unique staggered shank arrangement and overlapping front disc gangs. Adding in the adjustable gang angle for both the front and rear gangs allow the 24\" disc blades to use their 10 1/2\" spacing to the fullest for exceptional residue flow. Chisel shanks with straight or twisted points allow for maximum mixing and blending of the sized residue. Equipping the 2211 with ripper shanks and v-cap or shark-fin points allow for compaction management while incorporating the residue into the soil. Specifically equipped, the Landoll 2211 Ripoll is a true hybrid!",
      "Soil Management",
      "Producer expectations determine how the Landoll 2211 Ripoll will be set. The 2211 incorporates both front and rear adjustable disc gangs. The front gangs are responsible for initial sizing of the residue. The rear gangs handle the degree of levelness and final blending and mixing of the residue. The shanks (either chisel or ripper) are the workhorses of this machine. Whether working shallow with the chisels to capture the best mixing or working deeper to manage compaction, the 2211 is the machine to use. Soil management practices can be ever changing. The Landoll 2211 Ripoll is designed from the ground up to be able to meet many different expectations.",
      "Durable and Reliable",
      "The 2211 Ripoll is built in true Landoll style...precision, laser cut frame components embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty. Heavy-duty coil spring auto-reset shanks allow 1,750 lbs. of point load and 32\" of under frame clearance. The reset is the same for either the chisel or the ripper shank legs. The self-leveling hitch and single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability of the Landoll 2211 Ripoll beyond the competition.",

      "Landoll 6200 Series Tandem Disc Harrows are true multi-taskers. At home in high residue primary tillage applications as well as in secondary operations preparing a seedbed for planting, the 6200 Series from Landoll is the disc of choice. Features like the high ratio of weight per foot for penetration and cutting in the fall, as well as overlapping staggered gangs for exceptional leveling in the spring provide for use over two seasons. User-friendly adjustments allow the operator to fine-tune the 6200 Series to meet the needs of the season.",
      "Durable and Reliable",
      "The 6200 Series Tandem Disc Harrow is built in true Landoll style...precision, laser cut frame components that embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built-in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty.",
      "Gang angles are fixed at 20 degrees on the front and 18 degrees on the rear. Disc blades are spaced at 7\" or 8 3/4\". Blade diameters are 22\", 24\", 26\" or 28\" (model specific) to match the needs of the most discriminate customer. The self-leveling hitch and the single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability beyond the competition. Over-sized tires on walking tandem axles carry the load and allow for precision depth control across the entire width of the harrow. Pivoting gauge wheels on the front of the wings contribute to a controlled depth of the wings even at higher speeds.",
      "Sized to Fit",
      "The 6200 Series Tandem Disc Harrow is available in sizes from 12' to 50'. Rigid units are available in 12', 14' and 15' models. The folding units up to 36' fold in 3 sections while the units from 40' to 50' fold in 5 sections. The 3-section units transport under 17' 11\". The 5 section machines transport at 17' 6\".

      "\"One Trip\" Proven Seedbed Preparation Machine",
      "Conditions at planting time are all important to crop yields, and soil conditions and seedbed preparations are a major factor. Leveling, incorporating and bringing the soil to a nearly perfect seedbed condition in one trip across the field is what the Tilloll from Landoll is all about. Reducing field trips will save fuel, operator labor, and equipment dollars. Combining field trips also conserves moisture and provides a firmer seedbed. The soil is worked fewer times, depositing erosion-resistant residue and coarser soil on the surface to prevent sealing. Chemicals are successfully mixed throughout the seedbed in a single high-speed pass.",
      "True One Pass Tool",
      "The Landoll 875/876 Series Tilloll was designed from the ground up as a true one-pass seedbed preparation tool, not as an afterthought as a modified field cultivator. The Tilloll has 10-degree disc angles with spray shields behind the disc gangs to knock down the soil to allow a smooth surface for chemical application. The Tilloll offers spring cushion shanks with 10\" sweeps; under frame clearance is 25 1/2\". There is an incorporating reel behind the shanks to mix and blend the soil with the finer particles in the seedbed zone while incorporating chemicals. Clods and residue are left on the surface to curtail erosion. The field is finished with a heavy-duty three-bar spike harrow.",
      "Unique Design",
      "The incorporation reel and the spray shield are unique to the design of the Landoll 875/876 Tilloll. The unique disc combination resists conventional disc ridging. Couple that with the adjustable three-bar spike harrow and you have the recipe for the finest finisher in the industry.

      "The Sure Stand Concept",
      "The Brillion Sure Stand Concept has survived the test of time and the challenges from many competitors and many different seeding methods. However, the simplicity of the Sure Stand Concept is still the best way to seed legumes and grasses efficiently. The larger front notched roller firms the seedbed and put shallow indentations into the soil surface. The seed is metered from the seedboxes to free fall onto the deflectors. The deflectors spread the seed across the full width of the seeder for a broadcast style of seeding. The smaller rear roller, with its notches splitting the middle of the front indentations, squeezes the soil around the seed for the ultimate in seed to soil contact and consistent seed placement. That's the Sure Stand Concept.",
      "Models Available",
      "NEW! 16' Agricultural Seeder (SS-16 & SSP-16)",
      "New to the seeder line-up is the 16' Agricultural Seeder, which takes the popular Sure Stand Seeder concept to the next level. The 16' seeding width and 20-bushel capacity seedbox allow the operator to spend more time seeding and less time stopping to fill the seedboxes, maximizing efficiency.",
      "The seeder is equipped with the proven Micro-Meter seed metering system and can seed a variety of seeds at the correct depth to ensure optimal germination. The 16' Seeder features pneumatic down pressure on the rear roller for better seed coverage and squeezing out more air pockets in the seedbed. The heavy-duty frame to support the larger seedboxes delivers more weight per foot on the rollers. Any soil clods are easily crushed, further fine-tuning the seedbed for excellent germination rates.",
      "Three-Point Hitch Models (SSP Series)",
      "The SSP Series is available in 4', 5' and 6' sizes. Equipped with a meter and agitator box as standard equipment, these three-point hitch models will do everything the larger machines can do, only on a much smaller scale. Coil tine wheel track removers and blade agitators in the rear seedbox are standard. The close-coupled hitch on these models allows use with compact tractors for excellent maneuverability in close quarters. These units may be small in size, but they are big on features.",

      "Mid-Size Series",
      "High Capacity Series",
      "Why Risk It?",
      "Grass seed is a very expensive commodity. Because of Brillion's precision placement of seeds, seeding rates can often be cut to nearly half of the rates previously used. In many cases, the savings in seed alone will pay for a Sure Stand Seeder in just a short time. Don't risk your crop to another system. Don't settle for less. Use the one seeding method you can count on time after time...a Brillion Sure Stand Seeder.",

      "The Landoll 2400 Series Weatherproofer 1 (WP1) offers a combination of parabolic ripper shanks and tandem disc gangs that provide the most effective primary tillage tool in the market place. The ability to manage the soil, water, and residue all with a single pass is exactly what the industry has been asking for. The 2400 Series Weatherproofer 1 fulfills this need.",
      "Simplicity in Primary Tillage",
      "Primary tillage tools have had to evolve to meet the needs of current production agricultural practices. High yielding crops produce high levels of residue. Primary tillage tools have to be able to manage this residue effectively. The simplicity of the Weatherproofer 1 and the ease of adjustment allows this series to perform up to its expectations every time. Single point depth control sets the disc gangs to cut the residue. The shank working depth is adjusted via two bolts per shank leg. The Weatherproofer 1 Series is truly a \"set it and forget it\" type of tool. This simplicity makes operation of the Weatherproofer 1 very user friendly.",

      "Landoll's solid reputation of building quality tillage equipment is built into every 2400 Series Weatherproofer 1. Precision, laser cut frame components embrace the technology of robotic welding to its fullest. Durability is built-in, not added on. Incorporation of UHMW polymer in the lift axles provides a maintenance-free feature that eliminates daily greasing. Trunnion mount bearings that are cushioned by c-flex mounts are used throughout the disc assemblies and are covered by a 3-year warranty. Heavy-duty coil spring auto-reset shanks allow 3,600 lbs. of point load with a 16\" trip height. The self-leveling hitch and the single point depth control add to the list of items that extend the reliability of the Weatherproofer 1 beyond the competition.",

      "Seeding wildlife plots is usually not an exact science that can be easily replicated. Conditions change from planting to planting and the tools used to plant them need to versatile enough to accommodate. The Brillion Food Plot Seeder can prep and plant in one pass in some conditions. However, in most situations, some preparation needs to be done to ensure a proper planting process. The Brillion Food Plot Seeder can be adjusted to be used as a disc harrow by shortening the top link on the hitch to put the seeder full forward so just the disc harrow contacts the soil. This will allow for rugged tillage for a first or second pass. By lengthening the top link on the hitch, the cultivator segment and roller can be used as a complete preparation tillage tool. If the final seedbed is loose and fluffy, raise the three-point arms slightly, lengthen the top link some more to put the weight of the entire seeder on the pulverizer roller and roll the field to firm up the seedbed before planting. Once the seedbed is firm, level the seeder on the hitch, engage the seedboxes, and proceed with the seeding operation. In some cases, the seeded plot may need to be rolled again after seeding to ensure the best seed to soil contact. Many of these scenarios may or may not be present in every situation.

High residue levels, larger acreages, higher horsepower tractors and an ever-shrinking window of planting opportunities, the design team at Landoll had set the bar high. Customer feedback from today's top producers was used to eliminate the shortfalls found in competitive units. All aspects of ultimate seedbed preparation were taken into consideration in the new design of the 9600 Series Field Cultivator.",

This process of manufacturing provides the end-user with peace of mind that the Landoll 9600 Series Field Cultivator will be reliable day after day and season after season. The deep frame allows for a \"split the middle\" shank arrangement for unrestricted residue flow for perfect seedbed preparation. The frame is the anchor for the self-leveling hitch and walking tandem transport axles. The shanks are attached to 4\" x 3\" structural steel tubes that offer true 6\" shank spacing on all models.",

Single point depth control at the front of the machine provides precise depth control in  1/4 \" increments. Pivoting wing gauge wheels are standard on the 28 through 50-foot models. 1  1/4 \" hinge pins on the wing fold operate on UHMW maintenance-free bushings.",

      "Rugged and Durable",
      "All tillage tools need to be built to handle the stress of the fast-paced industry of today. However, deep tillage machines with depth capacities well below the normal operating depths need to be especially tough. In many instances, these tools will be operating in profiles that have never been touched by a tillage tool before. The Zone Commander has what it takes.",
      "The Frame",
      "Built with 6\" x 4\" structural steel tubing, the robotically welded frame is the foundation for the heavy-duty Cat. II, III or IV three-point hitch. The robust frame is the anchor for the lead colters that start the tillage process. The rear bar of the frame supports the Zone Commander's shank assemblies.",

The auto-reset shank assemblies allow for 3,500 lbs. of point load and 17\" of trip height. Rigid shear bolt models are also available for areas with minimal soil obstructions.",
      "The Shank Leg",
      "The heart and soul of the Zone Commander is the shank leg, which cuts a narrow slot into the soil profile. The geometry of the shank leg and the shape of the point combine to lift and lower the soil between the slots and develop a network of horizontal cracks and breaks between the shanks. This slot along with the cracks and breaks created in the growth profile allows water and oxygen to infiltrate the soil to enhance plant growth for the next season. The depth of the slot is determined by how deep and thick the compaction layer is. This process is instrumental in keeping the biological environment favorable for residue decomposition.",

Spring cushion lead coulters with different blade options cut the residue and slice the upper layers in the soil profile ahead of the shanks. Easily adjustable gauge wheels allow for quick, positive depth changes for different conditions. The Zone Commander is available in 3 to 7 shank non-folding models and in 7, 8 and 9 shank folding models.",
      "The Zone Commander is more than just another ripper. The Zone Commander can be an integral part of almost any type of cropping scenario. Even though these machines were initially designed for deep in-line tillage, some customers use the Zone Commander for incorporation practices such as sludge and manure application. Others have utilized the parabolic shank leg option for more disturbance on the soil surface. Still, others have opted for the low disturbance shank legs for the absolute least amount of surface disturbance. From true no-tillers to conventional tillage aficionados, the Zone Commander and its concept of compaction management is a yield enhancement investment.",

      "Producers will have peace of mind that even though the seeding capacity has gone up, the 4630-36 Folding Seeder will still afford the same industry-leading performance the Brillion Sure Stand Seeder is famous for. The 4630-36 Folding Seeder is a combination of the proven Landoll front folding grain drill hitch and the iconic Brillion 12' Sure Stand Seeder. This provides a state of the art machine with a quick transition from road transport of 13' 6'' to a full seeding width in a matter of minutes, right from the comfort of the tractor cab.",
      "Three Into One",
      "One of the key features of the 4630-36 Folding Seeder is the ability of the mainframe to allow each of the three seeders to operate completely independently of each other. That equates to the ability to seed 36' wide with the convenience and field hugging features of a 12' machine. The individual, frame-mounted three-point hitches raise and lower the seeders without changing the position of the mainframe. This allows the operator to raise the seeders at the end of the field for effortless turning.",

      "Providing a Solution",
      "Many dryland farming customers have experienced the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds and are looking for alternative methods or tools for weed control. Landoll has stepped up to that challenge and offers the 1700 Series Blade Plow as a solution for superior weed control for dryland farming operations. The Blade Plow is built tough to last and is designed with the user in mind; keeping the plow running level is key and all leveling adjustments on the 1700 Series are easy and user-friendly.",
      "How It Works",
      "The 1700 Series Blade Plow features 22\" coulters up front to cut residue ahead of the 6' wide blades that slice through any weed roots beneath the soil surface. The soil surface is virtually undisturbed and the rolling treaders on the rear of the machine grab any shallow-rooted weeds and rip them out of the soil getting them away from any available moisture.",
      "The rolling treaders are aggressive enough to pull up those small weeds and loosened roots and create a layer of mulch on top of the soil surface. This loose mulch helps conserve moisture under the area the plow has sliced through the soil creating a thermal barrier. Weed control and moisture conservation in one tool!",
      "Easy Leveling",
      "The 1700 Series Blade Plow is carried on radial tires with heavy-duty 8-bolt hubs and 3\" slip-in spindles. Not only does the Landoll Blade Plow have more load capacity than competitive models, but keeping the plow running level is much easier with consistent tire sizes across the width of the machine.",
      "All cylinders are located on top of the frame and are easy to access for making adjustments. The ability to precisely level the plow allows for a shallower depth of operation. The over-the-top hitch design controls front to rear rotational forces, further helping keep the plow level. The hitch aids in penetrating hard ground conditions and has positive tongue weight to keep the plow in the ground when the treaders are raised.",
      "Built To Last",
      "The 6' wide cutting blades on the Blade Plow are hard-surfaced to enhance wearability. The same size blades are used across the width of the unit to help with the consistency of parts. The teeth on the treaders are also hard-surfaced to last longer.",
      "The 1700 Series is built with enough strength to stay together; 5\" x 4\" x 3/8\" frame tubes are used on the front of the frame. A maintenance-free 3-hinge system is used on all sections for added durability, along with maintenance-free lift axles. The Landoll Blade Plow is durable to handle adverse conditions and is built to last...that's Landoll way.",
