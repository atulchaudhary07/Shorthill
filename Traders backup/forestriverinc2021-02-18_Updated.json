With two twin beds that make it into a king bed, full bathroom, TV, awning and all the great things this camper comes with, you just can't go wrong. Coming in at 2483 lb most tow vehicles can handle this small camper without even breaking a sweat. If you need a small camper with a king bed this is your winning ticket.",

The accessory door in the rear that allows you to put different types of camping items in your unit easily is by far one of the best attributes to the small floor plan. This one slide model has a large Dinette so you can sleep 6 and sit at least four in the dinette as well. We know you will enjoy all of the space available in the main part of the cabin in this great bunkhouse.",

Coming in at 2483 lb most tow vehicles can handle this small camper without even breaking a sweat. If you need a small camper with a king bed this is your winning ticket.",

Up front you get a full 60\"x80\" residential bed, a large dry bathroom, and full functional kitchen area featuring a 6 cu ft gas/electric refrigerator. In the rear you have a garage area that can fit up to a Razor 1000 or a large variety of other outdoor gear. With a capacity in the rear of more than 1500 lb, you can take just about anything you need to enjoy your campsite with you. Once the toys are out of the garage, the ramp transforms into a patio system with railing, and an easy to install magnetic screen door to keep the bugs out of the camper and fresh air coming in.",
